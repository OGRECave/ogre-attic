<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>v1.0.0 RC1 [Azathoth] (5 February
2005) - Major Release</P>
<P>1.0.0 is a big release, and due to us wanting to freeze interfaces
at the best possible level for 1.0.0 there are more interface
breaking changes in 1.0.0 than is typical for previous releases. For
the full lowdown on upgrading your code from Hastur (0.15.x) to
Azathoth (1.0.x) , please see the <A HREF="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/AzathothNotes">Azathoth

		defined so that you can load and unload resources in groups, and
		also set up group-specific search paths and scripting tasks. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Manual resource provision
		formalised; there is now a ManualLoader class that should be
		implemented when creating resources in code; this allows resource
		reloads to be possible in all cases 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Streaming support - data is now
		accessed from Ogre's virtual file system solely through the
		DataStream class (and subclasses), meaning that accessing very
		large files efficiently is now possible while still using the
		resource system. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Loading progress reports; you can
		now register ResourceGroupListeners in order to implement loading
		bars 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Thread safety - steps have been
		taked to make the resource system thread-safe to allow background
		loading. This feature is experimental and should only be used by
		experienced users.

<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>v0.15.0 [Hastur] (23 October 2004) -
Major Release</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Note: Ogre development branches will now have code
names; the 0.15 stable branch is known as 'Hastur', the continuing
development branch (which will be released as 1.0) is called
'Azathoth'. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Enhancements:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#ffff33">Binary mesh
	format enhanced</FONT>. Previously the binary mesh format did not
	support all the flexibility you could attain when you built meshes
	programmatically. This has been addressed, and the mesh can now
	store arbitrary vertex buffer formats, precomputed edge lists (for
	stencil shadows), and tangent-space vectors (for normal mapping).
	You are strongly adviced to use the OgreMeshUpgrade tool on all your
	meshes to uprade them to the latest version, and choose 'y' when
	asked if you want to reorganise your vertex buffers. The 'automatic'
	option is the quickest way to get your meshes up to date, and you
	may find them slightly faster to render as a result. <BR>Bear in
	mind that the .mesh size will increase because edge lists are
	precomputed and stored by default - if you don't intend to use
	stencil shadows then you can disable this with the '-e' parameter.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#ffff33">OpenGL
	Shading Language (GLSL) support</FONT>. This means Ogre now supports
	programmable shaders written in Cg, HLSL, GLSL and all variants of
	assembler (DirectX and GL). 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#ffff33">Explicit
	Radian, Degree and AngleUnit classes</FONT>. To resolve ambiguity as
	to which angle unit is being used, all methods which take an angle
	now take a Radian class. You can pass Degree instances to this too
	and get automatic degree-to-radian conversion. You can also use the
	AngleUnit class which defaults to the current angle units (see
	Math). Note that conversions are inlined and are thus very cheap;
	although if you want to avoid them entirely, use Radian. This is an
	<FONT COLOR="#ff6600">interface breaking change</FONT>, so you will
	need to update your code to use Radian(radianValue) or
	Degree(degreeValue) where you are using basic types to store angles.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Reflection
	enhancements</FONT>. Automatic reflections using dynamic planes are
	now simple to create using MovablePlane, and 'custom near clip
	planes' (oblique depth projection) are available to allow you to
	clip reflected geometry to an arbitrary plane without requiring
	additional hardware support such as user clip planes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Per-Renderable custom parameters
	can now be mapped into vertex / fragment programs (using ACT_CUSTOM)
	to better customise the look of your programmably shaded objects</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Skeletal animation optimisation:
	by default it now uses an approximation of true rotational
	interpolation which is slightly faster; true spherical interpolation
	is still an option if more accuracy is required.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Edge list improvements; Ogre can
	now deal with even more model construction variants while still
	retaining stencil shadow integrity

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Changes since 0.10.0:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">SceneQuery introduced; a generic
	way to query the SceneManager database of objects and world geometry
	in a way which is optimised per scene management technique but
	transparent for the client application. Currently only
	IntersectionSceneQuery is implemented but RaySceneQuery,
	SphereSceneQuery and others will soon be available too 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">ReferenceApplication introduced;
	this is a new library which sits on top of the main OGRE library in
	order to provide a reference implementation of combining OGRE with
	other libraries for use in a full application. Currently combines
	OGRE and ODE to provide an easy to use collision and realistic
	physics system, utilising the new SceneQuery functions for generic
	collision detection. Object to object collision is currently
	supported, together this object to world collision for the
	BspSceneManager (ie collision against Quake3 levels), see the
	BspCollision demo for an example. Per-object friction, bounciness
	and mass parameters are all definable, also most of the ODE joint
	types ie ball, hinge, hinge2, universal. World collision for the
	terrain managers will be added shortly. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Many structural enhancements to
	the GLRenderSystem, including an extension manager, separation of
	window creation etc into a GLSupport class (to enable platform
	specific window management). Win32GLSupport added so Win32 no longer
	uses SDL for window management.

	Node, in particular skeletal animation is now many times faster for
	large skeletons 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Interface breaking change since
	0.10.0: SceneNode::createChild now returns a Node* rather than a
	SceneNode*, you will have to cast it. This was to resolve
	virtualisation problems

<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>6 January 2002</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Most bugs in shader parsing sorted out. A few shader
effects are not supported yet, but most are there and look good.
Texture coordinate modifications are missing for the moment, but
environment mapping is in (albeit a little different from Q3A's
method - I chose to use cameraspace reflection vectors to produce the
effect because these are hardware accelerable, whilst Q3A's method of
using the vector from camera location to vertex is not), as are all
the shafts of light, animated flames etc.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>No MD3 models are being rendered so there are a few
blank spots in the level where a gargoyle, wall sconce etc should be.
I'm not going to implement this for now, I've proved the point I
wanted to prove which is that Ogre can handle this type of scene
well. It's just a few Q3-specific details which are missing which is
no big deal, I never set out to produce a working copy of Q3A.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I will be releasing another snapshot based on this
codebase, and also will release binary demos of all the examples.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Next: texture coordinate modifications, extensions to
the controller classes. Then particle systems. 
</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>5 January 2002</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Skydomes and skyboxes are in and working, giving you 3
types of sky to play with. Skyboxes are for static, wrap-around
environment textures like space, whilst skydomes are like skyplanes,
but curved.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Quake3 shader script conversion is going well, Ogre
loads in the .shader files and converts them to Material objects as
required, meaning that you can now see flames, shafts of light, TV
screens etc inside Ogre. Animated textures are being loaded but not
animated yet - I'm going to try and get animation working within a
nice generic OO controller framework if I can rather than bash out a
single-use approach.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>One thing I've noticed now the sky is being displayed
is there are 'sparklies' around the curved surfaces visible mostly
when there is a light-coloured sky. Damn. It appears the points
generated from the bezier patches don't quite match up with the
surrounding static geometry, meaning there are small gaps. This is a
TODO.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I still need to fix the odd crash point and a few
shaders aren't being loaded properly. Also environment mapping needs
a bit of work since Quake3 bases them on camera position -&gt; vertex
rather than camera eye vector -&gt; normal, which means they look
wrong. I should alos render the 'models' in the level i.e. geometry
that doesn't have lightmaps like gargoyles.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>27 December 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Skyplanes are now working. You can now create a plane
which is at contant distance from the camera at and orientation for
use as a sky. I'll be moving on to skyboxes imminently which will
allow full wrap-around skies.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I have also totally revamped the example code that is
included with the engine. Instead of the single TestApp project,
there is now an Examples folder with multiple projects under this
which demo each effect. I have also created an object-oriented
framework for the examples too, meaning they are now a lot better
structured and hopefully better to understand.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I also intend to release some binary demos soon so
people can quickly see what the engine is capable of without having
to build from the source. The good news this week is that I just did
a Release build of the Quake3 level renderer, and it runs at a very
sweet 170fps in windowed mode on my Athlon 1Ghz and GeForce 2. In
fullscreen mode at 1024x768 at 32-bit colour it still manages between
50 and 80 fps. I'm very pleased indeed. I would like to tidy up some
of the missing textures before I do a binary release so I'll be
sorting out the skybox support and other texture effects first.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>24 December 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Refactored the entity rendering routines in the base
SceneManager class to make them easier to reuse in subclasses.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Material class enhanced to contain all the other render
settings such as depth buffer parameters, culling modes, texture
filtering etc. It is now possible to drive all the rendering settings
via the Material class now so that no calls are required to the
RenderSystem class. This makes the settings more intuitive to use,
and ensures that you can have different settings per object if you
want by assigning different materials, and the SceneManager controls
the changes to the rendering settings.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Major rewrite of SceneManager::setMaterial and added
RenderSystem::_setTextureUnitSettings (used by the former) so that
only <B>changes</B> to the material settings are sent to the
RenderSystem. This ensures that rendering state changes are minimised
and that custom settings are reset only when required. This has
improved the framerate across the board by about 50%. A further
optimisation which is still to be made is ordering the materials in
the render sequence to minimise the render state changes still
further, e.g. scheduling 2 materials that have the same layer 0
texture but different layer 1 textures next to each other.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Started adding sky plane and sky box support to the
SceneManager class, but this is not yet functional.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Merry Xmas!</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>4 December 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>General Bezier Patch support through the PatchSurface
class.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Quake3 level loading uses curved surface support to
display Q3A's bezier curves. Custom shader scripts still to be done.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>IMPORTANT: To compile &amp; run the TestApp demo
application you will need to change line 414 of WinMainTest.cpp to
point at your Quake3Arena pak0.pk3, since I can't distribute Q3A
levels and textures for size and copyright reasons.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>11 November 2001</P>
<P>First Quake3 level rendering release. No support for shader
scripts or curved surfaces yet. 
</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>12 October 2001</P>
<P>Modified the material blending routines to make it more reliable
to fall back on multipass rendering whilst preserving all the correct
effects. To do this I had to simplify the basic multitexture blending
operations which automatically fall back to multipass, and require
that the application explicitly specifies a fallback blend multipass
operation if it chooses to use the more complex blending modes which
are only available under multitexture hardware. I hope by doing this
I keep it simple for most cases (people normally use jusy ADD,
MODULATE, REPLACE or ALPHABLEND anyway) whilst still allowing
complete flexibility for those who like to tinker with the obscure
modes.</P>
<P>Decided to make another point release even without the finished
Quake3 stuff because there's so much that's useful.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>9 October 2001</P>
<P>Object/scene blending operations (as opposed to multiple texture
layer blending on the same object) support has been added, allowing
new effects like transparency.</P>
<P>I keep getting distracted from my Quake3 level work but I am
progressing - the reason why I switched to this subject is that I
realised my fallback technique to multipass rendering when not enough
multitexturing hardware was available was not correct, and in order
to be able to fix it I needed these new blending options. I'm now
wondering whether to fix the multipass fallback now I have the tools
or to leave it until later. Right now, if you use more texture layers
than the hardware supports in a single pass, things won't look right.
I'll get to it.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>6 October 2001</P>
<P>Ok, remember the problem from 16 September re texture coordinates
and confusion over whether (0,0) was the top or bottom left corner of
the texture? Well it turns out that once again Direct3D is the odd
one out, and 3DS is actually using the more common convention, i.e.
(0,0) is the <I>bottom</I> left corner. I have therefore changed the
3ds2oof routine <I>back</I> to how it was before (using 3DS UV
corrdinates directly) and am flipping the texture itself in the
Y-axis when loading it in the Direct3D texture implementation to
compensate (D3DTexture.cpp). I should have checked more thoroughly
before changing things to be in line with D3D, I should have known it
would probably be the odd one.</P>
<P>I've done this because I want Ogre to follow industry standards
(e.g. right-handed coordinates, anticlockwise vertex winding) rather
than Direct3D's viewpoint which is usually the opposite, even though
it's Direct3D I'm working on at the moment. I do this because it's
what everybody will be used to when they come from maths texts or
modelling tools, and is the same as the OpenGL approach (so the
OpenGL port should be easier than Direct3D). I just compensate inside
my Direct3D-specific classes (e.g. by flipping the Z axis, changing
the culling mode, or flipping the texture as above).</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>5 October 2001</P>
<P>Progressive updates are being made to the OgreEngineIndoor module
in CVS. Quake3 levels are being loaded and coversion is in progress.</P>
<P>I have also fixed a couple more bugs: the ColourValue class was
implementing colours a little too bright and wrapped around to black
when pure white was specified. This has been fixed. In addition, the
mipmap generation was not generating enough mipmaps under Direct3D
because D3DX ignores requests for the number of mipmaps and generates
as many as required to reduce to a 1x1 texture. This caused smaller
mipmaps to be black and thus textures would wink out at long
distances. This has been fixed.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>16 September 2001</P>
<P>Slow going due to moving house. However, fixed a problem with
texture coordinates as converted from 3DS using 3ds2oof - I just
realised that 3DS uses UV coordinates where V=0.0 is at the <I>bottom</I>
of the texture map, instead of the top as with everything else! That
explains the strange textures on some models. Fixed 3ds2oof to make
V=(1.0 - V) during the conversion. Reconvert your models!</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>29 August 2001</P>
<P>Ogre now supports loading of resources from more flexible
locations, including compressed archives (.zip and Quake3 .pk3
files). You can specify a list of search paths and archives which are
either general across the whole of Ogre or specific to a resource
type (e.g. textures, meshes).</P>
<P>I've also added support for loading TGA images as well, since
Quake3 maps use them in places. 
</P>
<P>I have also dropped support for BMP files. This is because I have
had to implement memory-based versions of the image decoders to
support loading from archives, and to be frank I couldn't be bothered
to implement one for BMP since it's a naff format in my opinion and
tied to the Windows platform anyway. Ogre supports JPEG, PNG and TGA
which should be plenty of flexibility. Personally I think when you've
got PNG (for lossless) and JPEG (for lossy), you don't need anything
else.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>10 August 2001</P>
<P>Texture blending is now in and working! The new TestApp
demonstrates the functionality by loading a base model with a
standard texture, then adding a second texture layer and applying an
environment map to it. The keys 0-7 change the texture blending mode
to show what effects different parameters have.</P>
<P>I'm now moving onto other features; I want to look at Quake3 file
loading - there are a couple of things nagging me about managing
materials and entities that I'd like to look at but I'd really like
to get started on Q3A bsp files now. I also wanted to work on
animation, both within models (skeletal animation &amp; bones) and
for paths of objects (bezier curves &amp; bsplines), but I just don't
have time to do everything I want to! Q3A files first.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>5 August 2001</P>
<P>Back from a break for holidays!</P>
<P>The Camera class now allows a SceneNode to override it's position
and orientation when the Camera is attached to a SceneNode. This will
allow cameras attached to world objects etc.</P>
<P>Started implementing the texture blending operations - the
interface is complete, I'm now moving onto the Direct3D
implementation. For the moment I'm not worrying about minimising the
number of times that changes to blending parameters are made during a
frame - I'm still concentrating on minimising the texture changes,
which is the main overhead anyway. More optimisation will likely come
along with new SceneManager subclasses.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>21 July 2001</P>
<P>The Camera class now uses quaternions too. Camera rotation is a
lot more concise now (instead of storing &amp; trying to update 3
vectors I just have a single quaternion) and is more predictable and
hopefully more flexible for the future.&nbsp;</P>
<P>You can attach a Camera to a SceneNode (this is meant for use in
having cameras tracking other objects in the world) but I have yet to
implement this - I intend now that they're both on the same basis
that if you choose to attach a camera to a scene node then the
SceneNode overrides the camera's own position and direction, and
maybe even that they update each other (so telling a camera to look
somewhere would update the orientation of it's SceneNode too).</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>19 July 2001</P>
<P>Updated SceneNode class to use quaternions internally for all
orientations / rotations. This should both be faster and give me more
flexibility for the future. Also added a lot more manipulation
routines the SceneNode class which were sorely lacking before if you
wanted to move stuff around. The Camera class still uses matrices
internally but I intend to change that so that a Camera depends on
the SceneNode it is attached to for positioning rather than doing it
itself. To this end I will need to add extra features to the
SceneNode class to replicate functions like lookAt(), which is ok
since this will be handy for pointing other objects at each other
too.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>17 July 2001</P>
<P>Fixed an issue with the 3ds2oof utility - it now generates vertex
normals based on smooth groups rather than just averaging based on
the faces which use the vertex. This removes artefacts along model
'seams' e.g. the point where a texture wraps around on the model.</P>
<P>Reimplemented environment mapping using the new
Material::TextureLayer structure. Started work on adding more
manipulation features to the SceneNode class (body code still to do).</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>4 July 2001</P>
<P>Python now has full access to the engine, and it's working great.
I've also enabled callbacks into Python from the engine, so you can
register a Python class as a listener for frame update events so C++
calls Python every frame. Nice.</P>
<P>Future Python developments include an embedded version of Python
in Ogre so you can build a compiled application which still used
interpreted scripts for some things - this will be useful for level
scripting etc where the script can be kept in the level data. For now
though I'm going back to developing the core engine features .</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>20 June 2001</P>
<P>Spending an awful lot of time exposing all the necessary objects
and their interfaces to Python (up till now I have it working but
only a few interfaces were exposed). About 90% there now, with a few
issues to iron out - I had to extend the compiler heap limit to get
it to compile so far since the heavy usage of templates puts a great
strain on the compiler memory usage. In a few days I should be in a
position to do all my engine testing through Python as well as
through a custom C++ application (currently TestApp). 
</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>13 June 2001</P>
<P>Added FrameListener and FrameEvent classes in order to represent
the frame update callback functions in a more object-oriented way.
User applications now extend FrameListener and register their
interest in receiving frame events - this is based on the Java model
of event listening. Note that a boon of this method is that Boost
Python allows you to extend existing C++ classes so this provides a
perfect mechanism to have C++ call Python scripts when events occur. 
</P>
<P>I intend to extend this pattern to other events like collisions
when I implement them. 
</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>10 June 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Changed from using SWIG to Boost Python for Python
script integration. I changed because Boost Python supports C++
features much beter (including catching C++ exceptions and turning
them into Python exceptions, support for namespaces and overloaded
operators), it integrates better with my build cycle (doesn't require
a separate generate from interface files and can be built directly
into the library), and is more up-to-date with the latest Python
libraries. I was finding that SWIG's emphasis on pure C as opposed to
C++ was getting in the way, and Boost has definitely addressed this.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Introduced PythonLink class to expose classes to
Python.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>7 June 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Implemented Python integration using SWIG (Simplified
Wrapper and Interface Generator). You can now start and initialise
Ogre from a Python console and drive it interactively. More work
required to expose the full interface to Python however.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>31 May 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Cut over to CVS - CVS repository is now up and running
at SourceForge.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>20 May 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>SceneNode class integrated with Entity / SubEntity
classes. Working basic scene graph. Also reimplemented my previous
hack using DirectInput as a proper platform-specific user input class
- added the OgreUtility module for this purpose.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>15 May 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>SubEntity implementation complete, together with
customisable Materials at the SubEntity level. Material usage by
SubEntities is now indexed by the SceneManager so that rendering can
be grouped by Material such that as few as possible render state
changes take place. Note that this does not currently deal with
transparency.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>13 May 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Bugs with the new Mesh loading routines now ironed out.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>24 April 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Implemented Mesh, SubMesh and MeshManager classes for
loading Ogre Object Format files (converted from .3ds using the Ogre
3ds2oof tool). Decided to allow the original 3ds mesh to be broken
down into chunks specific per material or grouped as a whole
depending on requirements. The 3ds2oof utility makes a goos guess as
to what is best, based on the percentage of the vertices each SubMesh
uses out of the whole model - the lower the percentage the greater
chance it will have a dedicated vertex list rather than sharing the
whole since that saves sending unnecessary vertices to the pipeline.
However this can be customised with parameters since you may want to
use vertex buffers where it's more efficient to store 1 buffer even
if you only use parts of it.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>1 April 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Began overhaul of Mesh loading routines.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>30 March 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Switched to Doxygen for document generation since ccdoc
still doesn't support namespaces. Doxygen is better at
cross-referencing anyway and draws nice diagrams.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>24 March 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Added JPEG loading support, and moved this and existing
image loading code (PNG) into the Image class. BMP loading is still
supported but only on Windows platforms so this is still residing in
the D3DTexture class as a special case.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Improved the handling of non-square textures on
hardware that supports only square textures. The image is now
stretched into the square area so that the relative texture
coordinates are still valid and no black bands appear on the model.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>23 March 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Multiple viewports per window is implemented and
working Ok. Z-Order also applies so picture-in-picture views are
possible by placing a smaller viewport on top of another larger one.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>11 March 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Changed the default mechanism for supplying vertex
components (position, normals, texture coords, colours) to the
RenderOperation class. They were previously assumed to be part of the
same buffer with flags indicating which were present. However this
was too restrictive and prevented you using entirely separate memory
areas for different components, and adding extra components to
vertices on the fly. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Instead the RenderOperation class now takes pointers
for each component, and a 'span' value determines the gap between
each value. This allows you to use separate buffers if you like, but
also use a combined buffer if that suits you (by using the 'span'
value to skip over values in between).</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>6 March 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Implemented a 3DStudio conversion tool that works
directly from the .3DS files rather than from ASCII exports (as
previously) or from a MAX plugin as some others do, which requires a
3DS license. I based my code on an existing open source routine but I
have exteded it since it had a few shortcomings. The tool is called
'3ds2oof' because it converts 3DS files to a proprietary format, .OOF
(Ogre Object File). This is because it's more efficient for me to do
extra processing at conversion time like calculating bounding boxes,
splitting vertex buffers, strippifying etc (not that I'm doing all
this yet, but I <I>can</I>) rather than at load time as I would have
to do if I loaded direct from 3DS inside Ogre.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>1 March 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Over the last 2 weeks I reimplemented my interface to
the DirectX rendering pipeline in the new Ogre structure, under the
D3DRenderSystem class. Rendering requests are now packaged up in the
RenderOperation class, giving me more flexibility on how rendering
requests are submitted and handled. Now all the support classes (mesh
loading, scene management) are needed.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>11 February 2001</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I've been picking apart the platform dependencies in
Ogre so it'll be more portable. I'm also making it flexible enough to
handle any number of rendering windows and viewports within thse
windows, and also giving you the choice of an automatic rendering
loop (max frame rate) and a render-on-demand interface much like you
would need for an application like a modelling tool where you want to
free up cycles when things don't move and frae rate isn't the most
important thing.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I now have a nice hierarchy crossing the OgreEngine and
OgreWin32Platform modules, with functionality broken down into
RenderTarget, RenderWindow and Win32RenderWindow classes. Other
platforms can be implemented later, just replacing the
Win32RenderWindow maybe with XRenderWindow or MacRenderWindow.</P>
<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>29 December 2000</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Ogre development starts again after almost a year's
break while I finished my degree. Lots of research and design work at
this stage to work out how I should structure the object model.</P>
