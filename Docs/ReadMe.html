(Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine 
written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to 
produce games and demos utilising 3D hardware. The class library abstracts all 
the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL 
and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes.

following people are responsible for the blood, sweat and tears it took to bring 
you OGRE:</P><P><B>Steve Streeting (<A HREF="mailto:steve@stevestreeting.com">steve@stevestreeting.com</A>)</B></P><P>Steve 
had been thinking about creating something like OGRE since about February 2000, 
but work really started on it in 2001. Steve is responsible for the overall design, 
project management and changes to all the core functionality. He is also the main 
public contact for the project, at the above address. Steve is prone to ranting 
about why games should have the same coding and design standards as business software, 
and is based in St Peter Port, Guernsey (a small British island off the French 
coast).</P><P><B>Adrian 'cearny' Cearn&#x0103;u (<A HREF="mailto:cearny@cearny.ro">cearny@cearny.ro</A>)</B> 
</P><P>Cearny joined the project in February 2002. Cearny supplied the impetus 
and much of the implementation for switching OGRE to a completely dynamically-loaded 
library, provided the debugging memory manager, rationalised the codec system 
and has generally done a fine job of challenging my assumptions and generally 
improving the quality of the project. Cearny is based in Bucharest, Romania.</P><P><B>Thomas 
'temas' Muldowney (<A HREF="mailto:cearny@cearny.ro">temas@jabber.org</A>)</B></P><P>Temas 
joined the project in April 2002 and has been responsible for the Linux port and 
also generally on ANSI C++ compliance. He comes from a background of open-source 
development, and is currently a lead contributor to the Jabber open-source server 
as well as working on OGRE. He's based in Texas, USA.</P><P><B>Jon Anderson (<A HREF="mailto:janders@users.sf.net">janders@users.sf.net</A>)</B></P><P>John 
joined the project in November 2002 and has been responsible for developing the 
OctreeSceneManager and it's subclass TerrainSceneManager, so all those rolling 
terrain shots are down to his hard work. Jon is based in Minnesota, USA.</P><P>The 
following people have also made significant contributions to OGRE, and the team 
would like to thank them for their work:</P><UL> <li>Scott Chappel, for upgrading 
the Direct3D RenderSystem to v8.1</li><li>John Martin, for creating the 3D Studio 
Max tools</li><li>Ben Woodhead and Kenny Sabir, for several useful patches and 
helping out other users in the forums</li></UL><P></P><p align="left" CLASS="MainHeader">Contributing</p><p align="left">We 
welcome all contributions to OGRE, be that new plugins, bugfixes, extensions, 
tutorials, documentation, example applications, artwork or pretty much anything 
else! If you would like to contribute to the development of OGRE, please read 
the <a href="ContributorLicenseAgreement.html">Contributor License Agreement</A>, 
and then contact Steve Streeting at <A HREF="mailto:steve@stevestreeting.com">steve@stevestreeting.com</A> 
if you agree with the terms. </p><p align="left" CLASS="MainHeader">Keeping Up 
To Date</p><p align="left">The best place to keep up to date with developments 
on OGRE is the <A HREF="http://ogre.sourceforge.net">Official Web Site</A>. From 
there you can download the latest source code and documentation. You can choose 
between keeping bang up to date with CVS (Concurrent Versioning System) or by 
just getting the regularly released snapshots.</p><p align="left">The changes 
included in this current version can be viewed on the <A HREF="ChangeLog.html"> 
ChangeLog</A>. </p><p align="left" CLASS="MainHeader">Reporting a bug or requesting 
a feature</p><p align="left">This can be done through the Sourceforge project 
site, which you can find at <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogre">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogre</A>.</p><p align="left" CLASS="MainHeader">Licensing</p><P>OGRE 
is distributed as free software under the GNU Lesser General Public License (see 
<A HREF="License.html">License.html</A>). In summary this means that you can use 
OGRE for any purpose, provided that if you make changes to OGRE itself, you must 
release the changes back into into the public domain under the LGPL and make it 
clear where you have made the changes. Your own application can be distributed 
under any license you like. </P><P>This program is distributed in the hope that 
it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty

addition, if you use Ogre it would be nice if you displayed the Ogre logo somewhere 
in your application (start up or shutdown) for a minimum of 2 seconds. This splash-screen 
is displayed on the standard Ogre configuration dialog anyway, so if you use that 
you don't need to do anything extra. The logo is included in the download archive 
as Examples\Resources\ogrelogo.png.</P><P>Some textures distrubuted with Ogre
