<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>Summary</P>
<P>OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a
scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it
easier and more intuitive for developers to produce games and demos
utilising 3D hardware. The class library abstracts all the details of
using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and
provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive
classes. 
</P>
<P>This distribution contains the full original source code for OGRE
and is the most flexible way of obtaining the engine, although it
does require you to build it yourself. For people who want a little
more convenience, at the expense of a larger download and slightly
less flexibility, there is also a precompiled SDK release available
for some compilers.</P>

<P CLASS="mainheader" ALIGN=LEFT>Licensing</P>
<P>OGRE is distributed as free software under the GNU Lesser General
Public License (see <A HREF="License.html">License.html</A>). In
summary this means that you can use OGRE for any purpose, provided
that if you make changes to OGRE itself, you must release the changes
back into into the public domain under the LGPL and make it clear
where you have made the changes. Your own application can be
distributed under any license you like. Note that in the case of
OGRE, inlining and macros in headers are used purely for performance
or platform independence reasons, and including any of OGRE's headers
in your projects does not result in a derived work.

<P>In addition, if you use Ogre it would be nice if you displayed the
Ogre logo somewhere in your application (start up or shutdown) for a
minimum of 2 seconds. This splash-screen is displayed on the standard
Ogre configuration dialog anyway, so if you use that you don't need
to do anything extra. The logo is included in the download archive as
Examples\Resources\ogrelogo.png.</P>
