<p align="center" class="header">OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine)</p><p align="center" class="header">Source 
Distribution README file</p><p align="center" class="header"><A HREF="http://ogre.sourceforge.net">http://ogre.sourceforge.net</A></p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">Summary</p><p>OGRE 
(Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine 
written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to 
produce games and demos utilising 3D hardware. The class library abstracts all 
the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL 
and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes. 
</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">Authors</p><P>The following people are 
responsible for the blood, sweat and tears it took to bring you OGRE:</P><P><B>Steve 
Streeting (<A HREF="mailto:steve@stevestreeting.com">steve@stevestreeting.com</A>)</B></P><P>Steve 
had been thinking about creating something like OGRE since about February 2000, 
but work really started on it in 2001. Steve is responsible for the overall design, 
project management and changes to all the core functionality. He is also the main 
public contact for the project, at the above address. Steve is prone to ranting 
about why games should have the same coding and design standards as business software, 
and is based in St Peter Port, Guernsey (a small British island off the French 
coast).</P><P><B>Adrian 'cearny' Cearn&#x0103;u (<A HREF="mailto:cearny@cearny.ro">cearny@cearny.ro</A>)</B> 
</P><P>Cearny joined the project in February 2002. Cearny supplied the impetus 
and much of the implementation for switching OGRE to a completely dynamically-loaded 
library, provided the debugging memory manager, rationalised the codec system 
and has generally done a fine job of challenging my assumptions and generally 
improving the quality of the project. Cearny is based in Bucharest, Romania.</P>
<P><B>Thomas 'temas' Muldowney (<A HREF="mailto:cearny@cearny.ro">temas@jabber.org</A>)</B></P><P>Temas 
joined the project in April 2002 and has been responsible for the Linux port and 
also generally on ANSI C++ compliance. He comes from a background of open-source 
development, and is currently a lead contributor to the Jabber open-source server 
as well as working on OGRE. He's based in Texas, USA.</P><p align="left" class="MainHeader">Building 
an Application Which Uses Ogre</p><p align="left">OGRE will build under Windows using
Microsoft VC++ (version 6 with SP3+ or .NET), and under Linux using gcc 3.x (or gcc 2.9x with STLport).</p>
<p align="left"><B>Core DLLs</B></p><p align="left">OGRE compiles into 
a number of DLLs for use by applications. Client applications simply have to link 
to OgreMain.lib, which automatically starts up the core dll (OgreMain.dll). Both 
this and OgrePlatform.dll must be on your Windows path or in the same folder as 
the application. </p><p align="left"><B>Plugins</B></p><p align="left">Further 
'plugin' dlls are used to provide rendering system implementations (e.g. an interface 
to DirectX) and special features (e.g. a BSP-oriented scene manager). Plugins 
are configured using the 'plugins.cfg' file located in the same folder as your 
application. Here's an example:</p><p align="left">-----snip------------------------------------------------------</p><p align="left">PluginFolder=plugins\</p><P># 
Define D3D rendering implementation plugin<BR>Plugin=OgreD3DEngine.dll</P><P>-----snip------------------------------------------------------</P><P>This 
simple plugins.cfg tells Ogre to load all plugins from the 'plugins' folder directly 
under the application's folder, and to load OgreD3DEngine.dll, the DirectX rendering 
implementation (you have to have at least one of these, and currently only a DirectX 
plugin is available due to time constraints).</P><P>The best way to get started 
with OGRE is to look at the example applications which are included. These should 
make it clear to you how easy it is to get an OGRE application running in a surprisingly 
small amount of code!</P><P CLASS="MainHeader">Building New Plugins</P><P>If you 
want to customise the engine to add new features, but you don't want to do it 
in an application (say you want it to be reusable in binary form between projects, 
or maybe you just want to contribute to the engine without writing an actual application), 
you can write a plugin. Plugins do their work by calling the same interfaces an 
application can call - they can install new RenderSystem implementations, provide 
a SceneManager specialised for a particular scene type, add a new set of Controllers, 
whatever.</P><P>Plugins are built very much like applications - you link to OgreMain.lib 
and include the Ogre header files in your project. The only requirement is that 
you expose two methods from the dll you create:</P><P> <B>dllStartPlugin</B>: 
called when your plugin is loaded. Your plugin should create any classes, allocate 
memory, register with other Ogre objects etc. You should not assume that the RenderSystem 
has been initialised at this stage, it almost certainly has not been, so do not 
try to use the RenderSystem class or any class dependent on it (e.g. TextureManager). 
For instance, you could define a subclass of SceneManager in your dll and call 
Root::setSceneManager to provide your new implementation.</P><P><B>dllStopPlugin</B>: 
called on shutdown of the Ogre system just before unloading your dll. Release 
any memory you allocated here.</P><P>You can use the SOgreSfxPlugin, OgreD3DEngineDll 
and OgreBspSceneManagerDll projects as examples of writing plugins for Ogre.</P><P CLASS="MainHeader">Building 
The Ogre Libraries</P><p align="left">To build the core OGRE libraries you will 
need:</p><UL><LI> DirectX 8 SDK (or v7), library and include files on your path</LI><LI> 
Visual C++ 6 SP3+ or Visual C++.Net (VC7) </LI><LI>STLport (available from <A HREF="http://www.stlport.org">www.stlport.org</A>), 
built and with libraries and the appropriate dll (stlport_vc645.dll or stlport_vc745 
depending on your version of VC) on your path</LI></UL><P>Project files are supplied 
for VC6 (Ogre.dsw) and VC.Net (Ogre.sln). OGRE also uses additional open-source 
libraries (see <a href="#ack">acknowledgements</a> below) but these are included 
in the CVS repository and the download snapshot. </P><p align="left">You are strongly 
advised to review the documentation for Ogre before embarking on any changes. 
Ogre is a complex system, and is strongly pattern and OO design based, with many 
layers of abstraction being the norm. Unlike many 3D engines you will come across, 
Ogre has not been specifically designed around a single scene-type (e.g. running 
around inside a series of rooms, running over close terrain, flying through space), 
it can in theory be applied to all of them (although specialisations for specific 
scene types is required for performance, which is what the SceneManager is supposed 
to be subclassed for). This generality leads to a more flexible system, but you 
need to orientate yourself with the design first.</p><p align="left"><A HREF="Tutorials/index.html">Tutorials</A> 
and API <A HREF="docs/html/index.html">documentation</A> are available - please 
use them! </p><p align="left">The libraries are:</p><table width="100%" border="1" class="MainContent" CELLSPACING="0"> 
<tr> <td width="200">OgreMain.dll</td><td>The core dll which includes all the 
basic classes, and abstractions of all the engine components which will be refined 
per OS platform, rendering API, or per scene type. Everything which usees Ogre 
uses this library by linking to OgreMain.lib. This library must be on the path 
or in the current folder to be loaded at startup.</td></tr> <tr> <td width="200"> 
<p>OgrePlatform.dll</p></td><td><P>This library implements concrete versions of 
the classes required to be implemented for each platform. The implementation included 
with Ogre at the moment is for Win32, but this dll should be replaced (e.g. by 
OgrePlatform.so) on other platforms, exposing an identical interface but implementing 
the features for that platform.</P><P>This library is loaded dynamically by the 
PlatformManager class (in OgreMain.dll) and must either be on the path or in the 
current folder.</P></td></tr> <tr> <td width="200">Plugin_Direct3D7.dll</td><td>Plugin 
library which adds a RenderSystem implementation for Direct3D. This library is 
loaded dynamically by the plugin architecture described above, and must be located 
in the folder specified in plugins.cfg. At the moment this uses Direct3D 7 interfaces, 
because the effort of migrating to v8 was not justified (the only major addition 
was pixel shaders, and they were a hack in this version because of the nVidia 
/ ATI scrapping over standards and therefore unsuited to OGRE's middleware approach). 
OGRE will migrate to Direct3D 9 when released since this appears to be worth the 
effort, particularly the High-level shader language (HLSL).</td></tr> <tr> <td width="200">Plugin_BspSceneManager.dll</td><td>Plugin 
specialisation of the general-purpose SceneManager for rendering indoor levels 
based on a BSP tree. Allows Quake3 maps to be loaded and rendered very efficiently 
whilst exposing none of the complexity to the core Ogre system. This library is 
loaded dynamically by the plugin architecture described above, and must be located 
in the folder specified in plugins.cfg.</td></tr><tr><td width="200">Plugin_FileSystem.dll</td><td>Archive 
plugin that allows OGRE to read the filesystem of the target operating system.</td></tr> 
</table><p align="left">Each of the .lib files has 2 build configurations, Debug 
and Release. </p><P><B>Building Under DirectX 7 SDK</B></P><P>OGRE is configured 
to build under DirectX8 but is still using the DirectX 7 interfaces so can be 
built under this version if need be. I haven't upgraded the interfaces to v8 because 
I wanted to concentrate on engine design and features rather than porting the 
API calls to the new version (I have already ported OGRE and it's predecessors 
twice and to be honest I'm fed up with doing it!). I may wait until the imminent 
release of version 9 before I do another port.</P><P>So you can still build OGRE 
under the DirectX 7 SDK, you just need to make a small change to the linker settings 
of the examples and anything you create. In VC++, on the Project menu, click 'Settings'. 
In the 'General' section, in the 'Object/Library Modules' text box, change the 
'd3d8.lib' entry to 'd3dim.lib'</P><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left" CLASS="MainHeader">Building 
the Examples</p><p align="left">In the Samples folder, there are a number of subfolders 
each containing an example program (with the exception of the Common folder which 
contains the base code for all the examples, and the Media folder which contains 
all the textures, models etc). To build these you can either:</p><OL><LI>Load 
the individual .dsp or .vcproj project file from the example folder and build 
it individually (requires that you have already built the libraries as described 
above)</LI><LI>Load the Ogre.dsw or Ogre.sln workspace from the base Ogre folder, 
which contains <I>all</I> the examples and all the library projects, set the example 
you want to be the active one (right-click on the project explorer and click 'Set 
As Active Project') and perform a standard build. </LI></OL><P>The latter method 
has the advantage that you can flip between examples and the original OGRE code 
quickly, plus the fact that dependecies are in place such that if you make changes 
to the OGRE code or download new versions from CVS, the updated OGRE library will 
automatically be built when you build an example.</P><P>Here's a summary of the 
examples:</P><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CLASS="MainContent" CELLSPACING="0">

distributed with OGRE. You are expected to provide your own level data to use 
this example - edit the quake3settings.cfg file to specify the location of your 
pak0.pk3 file and the map you wish to load.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="114">EnvMapping</TD><TD WIDTH="994">Demonstrates

them through a function. This could be as simple as a scale factor, or be a little 
more complex such as a wave function.</TD></TR> </TABLE><P>All the examples are

Own Applications</P><P>The easiest way to get started with your own application 
is to start with the <A HREF="Samples/" TARGET="_blank">examples</A>. Feel free 
to reuse the framework there, which consists mainly of a base object called ExampleApplication. 
This handles all the engine initialisation and all you need to do is subclass 
it and override the createScene method to provide your own scene. You can optionally 
override any of the other methods if you wish to have more control over the scene. 
By default the camera is controllable via the standard freelook and WASD key combinations, 
but you can change this by replacing or subclassing the ExampleFrameListener class.</P><P>How 
do you find out what all the terms and classes mean? The best place to start is 
with the documentation. From this release onward, the full documentation will 
always be included as part of the source code release, rather than as a separate 
download. You can find the documentation <A HREF="Docs/html/index.html" TARGET="_blank">here</A>.</P><P>Also 
available are some <A HREF="Tutorials/index.html">short tutorials</A> which will 
give you a quick overview of the engine and how to use it. </P><p align="left" CLASS="MainHeader">Keeping 
Up To Date</p><p align="left">The best place to keep up to date with developments 
on OGRE is the <A HREF="http://ogre.sourceforge.net">Official Web Site</A>. From
