/** Compiler2Pass is a generic compiler/assembler
@remarks
	provides a tokenizer in pass 1 and relies on the subclass to provide the virtual method for pass 2 

	PASS 1 - tokenize source: this is a simple brute force lexical scanner/analyzer that also parses
			 the formed token for proper semantics and context in one pass
			 it uses Look Ahead Left-Right (LALR) ruling for semantic checking and also performs
			 context checking

	PASS 2 - generate application specific instructions ie native instructions

@par
	this class must be subclassed with the subclass providing implementation for Pass 2.  The subclass
	is responsible for setting up the token libraries along with defining the language syntax.
