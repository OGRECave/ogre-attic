This file contains a list of todo items for the PCZSceneManager plugin.
Some items are specific, some are not, it's just a list to keep notes for myself.

UPDATES:
-------------

* The PCZFrustum now uses a Culling Plane Reservoir which eliminates the constant memory
  allocations/de-allocations for PCPlanes during the culling process. (03/18/08)
* Light zones now only update affected list when portals move or lights move (Thanks Aulcard)
  (03/25/08)
* PCZSceneNodes now only save old spatial data when they move (Thanks Aulcard) (03/25/08)

KNOWN BUGS:
-------------
* Light traversal is not quite correct.  In order to avoid infinite recursion, I had to
  put in a hack which can potentially result in light not traversing into some zones properly.
  It will probably not be noticeable in most situations, but could potentially show up in
  very complex portal/zone setups.
* Some situations can cause infinite recursion crashes.  It is highly recommended to avoid
  situations where two zones interconnect in such a way that a viewer can look through
  a portal into one zone and straight through to another portal which leads back to the 
  zone the camera is in.  (that's bad zone design in the first place from an efficiency
  standpoint anyway).

TODO:
-------------
* Allow portals to connect to the same zone they are in
* Test function to prevent scenenodes from crossing portals which they won't fit through
* More testing 


OPTIMIZATIONS (todo):
---------------------
* All Portals calculate position update every frame, similar to how PCZSceneNodes were updating
  every frame.  This could be changed so that it is only done when portals move/changes.
* OctreeZone - utilize octree when determining portal visibility (currently does 
  separate check not accelerated by octree) for both cameras and light frustums).
* Add scissor rects for portals which are fully visible (i.e. all 4 sides)
* TerrainZoneRenderable has a function for intersecting segments.  Maybe (?) able to
  use my Ogre::Segment class instead of Ray?

FUTURE FEATURES:
----------------
* Add anti-portals?
