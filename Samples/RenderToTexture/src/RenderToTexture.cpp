    \file 
        RenderToTexture.cpp
    \brief
        Shows OGRE's RenderToTexture, or scene blending features.
    \par
        Note that this is a little rudimentary - it's because whilst
        OGRE supports lots of blending options, the SceneManager has
        to ensure the rendering order is correct when object RenderToTexture
        is enabled. Right now this is not quite right in the default
        manager so this scene is kept deliberately simple.
