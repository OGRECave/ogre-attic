<p align="center" class="header">OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine)</p><p align="center" class="header">Demo 
Distribution README file</p><p align="center" class="header"><A HREF="http://www.ogre3d.org">http://www.ogre3d.org</A></p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">Summary</p><p>OGRE 
(Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine 
written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to 
produce games and demos utilising 3D hardware. The class library abstracts all 
the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL 
and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes. 
</p><p>To run these demos you need to have DirectX 8 installed. The demos are 
as follows:</p><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Demo_BezierPatch</P><P>A simple demonstration 
of OGRE's ability to render variable detail bezier patches.</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Demo_Bsp</P><P>This 
demo shows how a custom SceneManager can be used to render specialised world areas 
quickly: in this case BSP data from Quake3 Arena. Note that you <B>must have a 
Quake3 Arena level</B> to use with it, along with the pak0.pk3 containing resource 
data. Edit the quake3settings.cfg file to tell the demo where to get these files 
from on your system.</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Demo_CameraTrack</P><P>An example 
of how OGRE can use spline paths to animate any aspect of the scene, in this case 
the camera, which follows a swooping path around the scene. These spline paths 
are as easy to set up as defining position / orientation points and telling the 
engine to do the rest.</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Demo_EnvMapping</P><P>Shows 
a calculated texture coordinate effect called 'environment mapping' which makes 
an object look reflective. This material is set up though a text script, and the 
calculation of the texture coordinates is done in hardware, if available.</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader"> 
Demo_Lighting</P><P>Demonstrates the use of dynamic lighting, along with billboarding 
effects for light flares.</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Demo_ParticleFX</P><P>Shows 
off OGRE's particle effect system. Particles are defined in text scripts to allow 
you complete flexibility and lots of options. This demo shows off point particles, 
directional particles, scattering and random colour effects, fading, gravity and 
the effect of moving emitters.</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Demo_RenderToTexture</P><P>Demonstrates 
rendering the contents of the scene to a texture, then using that texture in the 
scene. In this demo it gives a 'hall or mirrors' effect. <B>Note: this demo only 
works on Direct3D renderers at the moment</B>.</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Demo_SkeletalAnimation</P><P>Shows 
off OGRE's skeletal animation system, where a mesh is deformed according to the 
animation of 'bones' under the surface of the mesh. This allows very smooth animation 
with efficient storage requirements, and also allows blending of multiple animations.</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Demo_SkyBox, 
Demo_SkyDome, Demo_SkyPlane</P><P>These demos show OGRE's support for various 
'sky' approaches. These skies can be combined for a multi-layer effect.</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Demo_Terrain</P><P>Shows 
off another SceneManager plugin which customises the scene approach for rendering 
geo-mipmapped terrain.</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Demo_TextureFX</P><P>Demonstrates 
how you can use material properties to create animated textures. They can have 
multiple frames, rotate, scale, scroll etc with various different schemes. Underlying 
all this is the OGRE 'Controller' framework which lets you link objects together 
and make them derive values from each other, after transforming them somehow (e.g. 
through a wave function).</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Demo_Transparency</P><P>Shows 
a series of transparent objects. OGRE automatically handles transparency; it handles 
the depth buffer changes that are required to correctly render transparent objects, 
and renders the objects in the correct order to ensure they look correct on screen 
when composited.</P><P CLASS="SectionHeader">Solitaire</P><P>This is actually 
a complete implementation of the classic card game by <A HREF="http://badcamelgaming.sourceforge.net">Bad 
Camel Gaming</A>, except in 3D. This is a good example of a complete application 
writte in OGRE. We guarantee that you've never seen this many particles in a card 
game before! :)</P><p align="left" class="MainHeader">OGRE Authors</p><P>The following 
people are responsible for the blood, sweat and tears it took to bring you OGRE:</P><P><B>Steve 
Streeting (<A HREF="mailto:steve@stevestreeting.com">steve@stevestreeting.com</A>)</B></P><P>Steve 
had been thinking about creating something like OGRE since about February 2000, 
but work really started on it in 2001. Steve is responsible for the overall design, 
project management and changes to all the core functionality. He is also the main 
public contact for the project, at the above address. Steve is prone to ranting 
about why games should have the same coding and design standards as business software, 
and is based in St Peter Port, Guernsey (a small British island off the French 
coast).</P><P><B>Adrian 'cearny' Cearn&#x0103;u (<A HREF="mailto:cearny@cearny.ro">cearny@cearny.ro</A>)</B> 
</P><P>Cearny joined the project in February 2002. Cearny supplied the impetus 
and much of the implementation for switching OGRE to a completely dynamically-loaded 
library, provided the debugging memory manager, rationalised the codec system 
and has generally done a fine job of challenging my assumptions and generally 
improving the quality of the project. Cearny is based in Bucharest, Romania.</P><P><B>Thomas 
'temas' Muldowney (<A HREF="mailto:cearny@cearny.ro">temas@jabber.org</A>)</B></P><P>Temas 
joined the project in April 2002 and has been responsible for the Linux port and 
also generally on ANSI C++ compliance. He comes from a background of open-source 
development, and is currently a lead contributor to the Jabber open-source server 
as well as working on OGRE. He's based in Texas, USA.</P><P><B>Jon Anderson (<A HREF="mailto:janders@users.sf.net">janders@users.sf.net</A>)</B></P><P>John 
joined the project in November 2002 and has been responsible for developing the 
OctreeSceneManager and it's subclass TerrainSceneManager, so all those rolling 
terrain shots are down to his hard work. Jon is based in Minnesota, USA.</P><P>The 
following people have also made significant contributions to OGRE, and the team 
would like to thank them for their work:</P><UL> <li>Scott Chappel, for upgrading 
the Direct3D RenderSystem to v8.1</li><li>John Martin, for creating the 3D Studio 
Max tools</li><li>Ben Woodhead and Kenny Sabir, for several useful patches and 
helping out other users in the forums</li><li>lots of other people!</li></UL><P></P><p align="left" CLASS="MainHeader">Contributing</p><p align="left">We 
welcome all contributions to OGRE, be that new plugins, bugfixes, extensions, 
tutorials, documentation, example applications, artwork or pretty much anything 
else! If you would like to contribute to the development of OGRE, please read 
the <a href="../Docs/ContributorLicenseAgreement.html">Contributor License Agreement</A>, 
and then contact Steve Streeting at <A HREF="mailto:steve@stevestreeting.com">steve@stevestreeting.com</A> 
if you agree with the terms. </p><p align="left" CLASS="MainHeader">Keeping Up 
To Date</p><p align="left">The best place to keep up to date with developments 
on OGRE is the <A HREF="http://www.ogre3d.org">Official Web Site</A>. From 
there you can download the latest source code and documentation. You can choose 
between keeping bang up to date with CVS (Concurrent Versioning System) or by 
just getting the regularly released snapshots.</p><p align="left">The changes 
included in this current version can be viewed on the <A HREF="../Docs/ChangeLog.html"> 
ChangeLog</A>. </p><p align="left" CLASS="MainHeader">Reporting a bug or requesting 
a feature</p><p align="left">This can be done through the Sourceforge project 
site, which you can find at <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogre">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogre</A>.</p><p align="left"><b>A 
NOTE ABOUT DIRECTX 8.1</b> <b>RENDERSYSTEM</b>: OGRE provides multiple render 
system implementations. In the larger demos such as Bsp and Terrain, the Direct3D 
7 and OpenGL render systems will perform BETTER than the Direct3D 8 render system 
(as selected on the setup dialog). This is because acceptable geometry structures 
were made more restricted in Dx8 and so far we have not propagated this restriction 
into the rest of the engine, meaning some translation is required for Dx8. This 
might seem counter-intuitive to some who would expect Dx8 to outperform Dx7.</p><p align="left" CLASS="MainHeader">Licensing</p><P>OGRE

addition, if you use Ogre it would be nice if you displayed the Ogre logo somewhere 
in your application (start up or shutdown) for a minimum of 2 seconds. This splash-screen 
is displayed on the standard Ogre configuration dialog anyway, so if you use that 
you don't need to do anything extra. The logo is included in the download archive 
as Examples\Resources\ogrelogo.png.</P><P>Some textures distrubuted with Ogre
