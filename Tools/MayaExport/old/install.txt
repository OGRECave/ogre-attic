To install the Maya Plugin:
---------------------------

1. Copy OgreMayaExport.mll to Maya\bin\plugins
2. Copy OgreMain.dll, and all the supporting dlls in the folder above this one into Maya\bin
3. Start Maya
4. Go to Window->Settings/Preferences->Plugin Manager
5. Tick both boxes next to OgreMayaExport.mll

You can now export static meshes using File->Export Selection and selecting 'OgreGeometry' as the file type.

The OGRE team would like to thank Marc Hernandez for developing this exporter.
