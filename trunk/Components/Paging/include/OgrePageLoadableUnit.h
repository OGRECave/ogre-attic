	@remarks
		Loadable units are able to load and unload certain parts in a background thread.
		However, we assume that the render system is not threadsafe in itself, and
		partition up the tasks so that those that need to be performed in the 
		main render thread (which is generally those that access GPU resources)
		are clearly identified. The sequence of loading is:

		<ol><li>Construct (main render thread): do the minimum to construct an instance</li>
		<li>Prepare (background thread): pull data from disk, generate data on the CPU, process. No
			GPU resources may be accessed here. </li>
		<li>Load (main render thread): create / modify GPU resources</li>
		</ol>

		The sequence of unloading is:
		<ol>
		<li>Unload (main render thread): destroy GPU resources</li>
		<li>Unprepare (background thread): free up CPU resources or otherwise perform shutdown
			tasks that do not access the GPU.</li>
		<li>Destroy (main render thread): physical deletion</li>		
		</ol>

		Subclasses should implement the protected prepareImpl() et al methods rather
		than the main public methods.
