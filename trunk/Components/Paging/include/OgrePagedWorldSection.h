		The reason for PagedWorldSection is that you may wish to cater for multiple
		sections of your world which use a different approach to paging (ie a
		different PageStrategy), or which are significantly far apart or separate 
		that the parameters you want to pass to the PageStrategy are different.
	@par
		PagedWorldSection instances are fully contained within the PagedWorld and
		their definitions are loaded in their entirety when the PagedWorld is
		loaded. However, no Page instances are initially loaded - those are the
		responsibility of the PageStrategy.
