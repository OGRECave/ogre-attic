Log</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">v0.99c (19 July 2002)</p><P ALIGN="left">Changes 
since 0.99b:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Enhancements:</P><UL><LI>New MeshSerializer class 
for importing / exporting mesh data, to be used as the framework for all future 
modelling tool exporters </LI><LI>Milkshape3D exporter provided, which uses MeshSerializer 
to export to the new .mesh file format. This replaces the 3ds2oof utility which 
along with the .oof is now deprecated, although .oof models can still be loaded. 
In this version the Milkshape exporter only exports static mesh data without bones 
or animation.</LI><LI>SceneNode now supports scaling (uniform and non-uniform), 
including the option to inherit parent scale or just use own</LI><LI>Completely 
new source code folder layout; should be more obvious than the old one. All dependencies 
are now included in the code structure to avoid having to distribute binary libraries</LI><LI>Boost 
added to the Dependencies area</LI><LI>New tutorial added, kindly written by Nicholas 
Green</LI></UL><P>Work-in-progress:</P><UL><LI>Linux makefiles now present, buildable 
with gcc 3+</LI><LI>SDL / OpenGL render system implementation provided, not totally 
complete yet but almost there</LI><LI>Skeletal animation classes (Animation, AnimationTrack, 
KeyFrame, Skeleton, Bone) </LI></UL><P>Bugfixes:</P><UL><LI>Math::NEG_INFINITY 
now correctly defined</LI><LI>ColourValue getAsLongARGB alpha bug fixed</LI><LI>Problems 
with camera positioning &amp; lookat behaviour when attached to a SceneNode fixed</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE><p align="left" class="MainHeader">v0.99b 
(9 June 2002)</p><P ALIGN="left">Changes since 0.98b:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Enhancements:</P><UL><LI>Particle 
systems implemented, including customisable emitters / affectors through the use 
of plugins, defining particle system templates through text scripts for easy modification, 
flexible culling options, flat and oriented billboards for point or directional 
particles, fast-forwarding of systems to avoid obvious particle system startup, 
force application, randomised colours &amp; emission angles, randomised velocities 
and lifetimes and much more.</LI><LI>Billboarding support (used by particle systems, 
but can also be used on their own to create backgrounds, static light flares etc)</LI><LI>Now 
builds under VC.Net (VC7), .sln and .vcproj files are now included in the distribution</LI><LI>Zip 
archives now cache a file index for more efficient retrieval</LI><LI>StringInterface 
base class and helper classes like ParamCommand and StringConverter now available 
to make scriptable classes easier to create</LI></UL><P>Bugfixes:</P><UL><LI>Several 
bugs in 3DS2OOF 3D Studio converter fixed, such as exported files including camera 
&amp; lights (these are now ignored), objects with missing SmoothGroups, and issue 
with merging multiple objects</LI><LI>Environment mapping bug which caused incorrect 
wrapping is now fixed</LI><LI>All container 'wrappers' have now been replaced 
with the original STL class since we are now using STLport and don't have the 
dll boundary problems present in theMicrosoft STL implementation</LI><LI>SceneNodes 
now derive their orientation &amp; position on demand if they are out of date</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE><p align="left" class="MainHeader">v0.98b 
(29 March 2002)</p><p align="left">Changes since 0.97e:</p><UL><LI>Material scripts. 
All materials can now be specified in .material files, which are loaded at startup 
and can be altered without recompiling your application. Tweak to your hearts 
content! See the material scripting section in the Tutorials for more information.</LI><LI>Landscape 
rendering - a ROAM scene manager example implementation is now included in the 
distribution, together with an example demo. Whilst the ROAM approach will not 
be developed further due to it's relatively high CPU overhead, it serves as an 
example of how vastly different scene managers can be plugged into Ogre. </LI><LI>Billboarding. 
Billboards can now be used to create special effects. Particle systems using this 
facility are under development.</LI><LI>Better culling on the standard scene manager. 
The standard non-scene-specific scene manager now hierarchically culls movables 
based on their bounding boxes. A triangle counter monitors culling performance.</LI><LI>Refactored 
the methods called in the main rendering loop in SceneManager to allow subclasses 
to modify the behaviour more easily without having to duplicate code.</LI><LI>Better 
compliance with STL standards. Ogre is now built using <A HREF="http://www.stlport.org">STLport</A> 
on both Windows and Linux, and this has necessitated a closer fit with the STL 
standard rather than the Microsoft implementation. </LI></UL><P>&nbsp;</P><p align="left" class="MainHeader">v0.97e 
(16 Feb 2002)</p><p align=left">Changes since 0.97b:</p><UL><LI>Archive driver 
system is in! Say bye-bye to the Ogre::Archive class and welcome to dynamically-loaded 
archive codecs!</LI><LI>Two archive codecs are provided: FileSystem codec (works 
like a normal directory) and Zip Archive codec (works with Zip archives)</LI><LI>Changed 
all examples and the Indoor Engine to work with the new codecs</LI><LI>Modified 
the way ResourceManager::_findResourceData returns data: now it takes a pointer 
to a DataChunk and fills the pointed object with all the data, thus avoiding unnecesary 
memory copying (and eventually fragmentation)</LI><LI>Some cosmetic changes to 
the way plug-ins are loaded - no need to specify the extension of the plug-in 
anymore, and it is registered as given in the Plugins.cfg file. This is because 
we don't want to load a Dll two times - the first time as [PluginPath]\PluginName.dll 
and the second time as plain PluginName</LI><LI>Cosmetic changes in projects and 
workspaces. They should give no error when compiling and you shouldn't need to 
create the necessary directories yourselves</LI><LI>The Resources folder has changed. 
The two .oof models and their textures now reside in zip archives to reflect the 
usage of the new Archive codecs.</LI></UL><p align="left" class="MainHeader">v0.97b 
(6 Feb 2002)</p><p align="left">Changes since 0.96b:</p><UL><LI>Added some more 
standard Controller objects to allow easy texture scrolling, rotating and scaling. 
Added support for these to the Quake3 renderer .</LI><LI>Wave-based controllers 
allow texture modifications (among other things) to be based on wave types rather 
than just constant effects</LI><LI>Added more friendly error dialog when an unhandled 
exception is thrown</LI><LI>Fixed a couple of bugs in the config dialog which 
causes crashes</LI><LI>Fogging enabled - scene-wide or customised per material</LI></UL><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">v0.96b 
(6 January 2002)</p><p align="left">I've changed this log a little to be more 
concise regarding changes made between snapshot versions. </p><p align="left">Changes 
since 0.95b:</p><UL><LI>Animated tetxure support. Each texture layer can have 
multiple frames, with one being active at a time.</LI><LI>Controller architecture. 
Controller allow object properties to be updated based on other events or values 
whilst only loosely coupling the source and destination objects together. In this 
version Controllers are used for animating texture layers by setting the active 
texture frame based on a frame timer object.</LI><LI>Quake 3 .shader script support. 
Animated textures, multilayer textures etc now being loaded in. No scrolling, 
rotating or stretching effects yet though</LI><LI>Skyplanes, skydomes and skyboxes 
are now supported</LI><LI>Major improvement in rendering speed thanks to a far 
smarter render state management approach. </LI><LI>Transparent objects now always 
render correctly when in front of solid objects.</LI></UL><p align="left" class="MainHeader">6 
January 2002</p><p align="left">Most bugs in shader parsing sorted out. A few 
shader effects are not supported yet, but most are there and look good. Texture 
coordinate modifications are missing for the moment, but environment mapping is 
in (albeit a little different from Q3A's method - I chose to use cameraspace reflection 
vectors to produce the effect because these are hardware accelerable, whilst Q3A's 
method of using the vector from camera location to vertex is not), as are all 
the shafts of light, animated flames etc.</p><p align="left">No MD3 models are 
being rendered so there are a few blank spots in the level where a gargoyle, wall 
sconce etc should be. I'm not going to implement this for now, I've proved the 
point I wanted to prove which is that Ogre can handle this type of scene well. 
It's just a few Q3-specific details which are missing which is no big deal, I 
never set out to produce a working copy of Q3A.</p><p align="left">I will be releasing 
another snapshot based on this codebase, and also will release binary demos of 
all the examples.</p><p align="left">Next: texture coordinate modifications, extensions 
to the controller classes. Then particle systems. </p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">5 
January 2002</p><p align="left">Skydomes and skyboxes are in and working, giving 
you 3 types of sky to play with. Skyboxes are for static, wrap-around environment 
textures like space, whilst skydomes are like skyplanes, but curved.</p><p align="left">Quake3 
shader script conversion is going well, Ogre loads in the .shader files and converts 
them to Material objects as required, meaning that you can now see flames, shafts 
of light, TV screens etc inside Ogre. Animated textures are being loaded but not 
animated yet - I'm going to try and get animation working within a nice generic 
OO controller framework if I can rather than bash out a single-use approach.</p><p align="left">One 
thing I've noticed now the sky is being displayed is there are 'sparklies' around 
the curved surfaces visible mostly when there is a light-coloured sky. Damn. It 
appears the points generated from the bezier patches don't quite match up with 
the surrounding static geometry, meaning there are small gaps. This is a TODO.</p><p align="left">I 
still need to fix the odd crash point and a few shaders aren't being loaded properly. 
Also environment mapping needs a bit of work since Quake3 bases them on camera 
position -&gt; vertex rather than camera eye vector -&gt; normal, which means 
they look wrong. I should alos render the 'models' in the level i.e. geometry 
that doesn't have lightmaps like gargoyles.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">27 
December 2001</p><p align="left">Skyplanes are now working. You can now create 
a plane which is at contant distance from the camera at and orientation for use 
as a sky. I'll be moving on to skyboxes imminently which will allow full wrap-around 
skies.</p><p align="left">I have also totally revamped the example code that is 
included with the engine. Instead of the single TestApp project, there is now 
an Examples folder with multiple projects under this which demo each effect. I 
have also created an object-oriented framework for the examples too, meaning they 
are now a lot better structured and hopefully better to understand.</p><p align="left">I 
also intend to release some binary demos soon so people can quickly see what the 
engine is capable of without having to build from the source. The good news this 
week is that I just did a Release build of the Quake3 level renderer, and it runs 
at a very sweet 170fps in windowed mode on my Athlon 1Ghz and GeForce 2. In fullscreen 
mode at 1024x768 at 32-bit colour it still manages between 50 and 80 fps. I'm 
very pleased indeed. I would like to tidy up some of the missing textures before 
I do a binary release so I'll be sorting out the skybox support and other texture 
effects first.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">24 December 2001</p><p align="left">Refactored 
the entity rendering routines in the base SceneManager class to make them easier 
to reuse in subclasses.</p><p align="left">Material class enhanced to contain 
all the other render settings such as depth buffer parameters, culling modes, 
texture filtering etc. It is now possible to drive all the rendering settings 
via the Material class now so that no calls are required to the RenderSystem class. 
This makes the settings more intuitive to use, and ensures that you can have different 
settings per object if you want by assigning different materials, and the SceneManager 
controls the changes to the rendering settings.</p><p align="left">Major rewrite 
of SceneManager::setMaterial and added RenderSystem::_setTextureUnitSettings (used 
by the former) so that only <B>changes</B> to the material settings are sent to 
the RenderSystem. This ensures that rendering state changes are minimised and 
that custom settings are reset only when required. This has improved the framerate 
across the board by about 50%. A further optimisation which is still to be made 
is ordering the materials in the render sequence to minimise the render state 
changes still further, e.g. scheduling 2 materials that have the same layer 0 
texture but different layer 1 textures next to each other.</p><p align="left">Started 
adding sky plane and sky box support to the SceneManager class, but this is not 
yet functional.</p><p align="left">Merry Xmas!</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">4 
December 2001</p><p align="left">General Bezier Patch support through the PatchSurface 
class.</p><p align="left">Quake3 level loading uses curved surface support to 
display Q3A's bezier curves. Custom shader scripts still to be done.</p><p align="left">IMPORTANT: 
To compile &amp; run the TestApp demo application you will need to change line 
414 of WinMainTest.cpp to point at your Quake3Arena pak0.pk3, since I can't distribute 
Q3A levels and textures for size and copyright reasons.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">11 
November 2001</p><p>First Quake3 level rendering release. No support for shader 
scripts or curved surfaces yet. </p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">12 October 
2001</p><p>Modified the material blending routines to make it more reliable to 
fall back on multipass rendering whilst preserving all the correct effects. To 
do this I had to simplify the basic multitexture blending operations which automatically 
fall back to multipass, and require that the application explicitly specifies 
a fallback blend multipass operation if it chooses to use the more complex blending 
modes which are only available under multitexture hardware. I hope by doing this 
I keep it simple for most cases (people normally use jusy ADD, MODULATE, REPLACE 
or ALPHABLEND anyway) whilst still allowing complete flexibility for those who 
like to tinker with the obscure modes.</p><p>Decided to make another point release 
even without the finished Quake3 stuff because there's so much that's useful.</p><p></p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">9 
October 2001</p><p>Object/scene blending operations (as opposed to multiple texture 
layer blending on the same object) support has been added, allowing new effects 
like transparency.</p><p>I keep getting distracted from my Quake3 level work but 
I am progressing - the reason why I switched to this subject is that I realised 
my fallback technique to multipass rendering when not enough multitexturing hardware 
was available was not correct, and in order to be able to fix it I needed these 
new blending options. I'm now wondering whether to fix the multipass fallback 
now I have the tools or to leave it until later. Right now, if you use more texture 
layers than the hardware supports in a single pass, things won't look right. I'll 
get to it.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">6 October 2001</p><p>Ok, remember 
the problem from 16 September re texture coordinates and confusion over whether 
(0,0) was the top or bottom left corner of the texture? Well it turns out that 
once again Direct3D is the odd one out, and 3DS is actually using the more common 
convention, i.e. (0,0) is the <i>bottom</i> left corner. I have therefore changed 
the 3ds2oof routine <i>back</i> to how it was before (using 3DS UV corrdinates 
directly) and am flipping the texture itself in the Y-axis when loading it in 
the Direct3D texture implementation to compensate (D3DTexture.cpp). I should have 
checked more thoroughly before changing things to be in line with D3D, I should 
have known it would probably be the odd one.</p><p>I've done this because I want 
Ogre to follow industry standards (e.g. right-handed coordinates, anticlockwise 
vertex winding) rather than Direct3D's viewpoint which is usually the opposite, 
even though it's Direct3D I'm working on at the moment. I do this because it's 
what everybody will be used to when they come from maths texts or modelling tools, 
and is the same as the OpenGL approach (so the OpenGL port should be easier than 
Direct3D). I just compensate inside my Direct3D-specific classes (e.g. by flipping 
the Z axis, changing the culling mode, or flipping the texture as above).</p><p></p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">5 
October 2001</p><p>Progressive updates are being made to the OgreEngineIndoor 
module in CVS. Quake3 levels are being loaded and coversion is in progress.</p><p>I 
have also fixed a couple more bugs: the ColourValue class was implementing colours 
a little too bright and wrapped around to black when pure white was specified. 
This has been fixed. In addition, the mipmap generation was not generating enough 
mipmaps under Direct3D because D3DX ignores requests for the number of mipmaps 
and generates as many as required to reduce to a 1x1 texture. This caused smaller 
mipmaps to be black and thus textures would wink out at long distances. This has 
been fixed.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">16 September 2001</p><p>Slow 
going due to moving house. However, fixed a problem with texture coordinates as 
converted from 3DS using 3ds2oof - I just realised that 3DS uses UV coordinates 
where V=0.0 is at the <i>bottom</i> of the texture map, instead of the top as 
with everything else! That explains the strange textures on some models. Fixed 
3ds2oof to make V=(1.0 - V) during the conversion. Reconvert your models!</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">29 
August 2001</p><p>Ogre now supports loading of resources from more flexible locations, 
including compressed archives (.zip and Quake3 .pk3 files). You can specify a 
list of search paths and archives which are either general across the whole of 
Ogre or specific to a resource type (e.g. textures, meshes).</p><p>I've also added 
support for loading TGA images as well, since Quake3 maps use them in places. 
</p><p>I have also dropped support for BMP files. This is because I have had to 
implement memory-based versions of the image decoders to support loading from 
archives, and to be frank I couldn't be bothered to implement one for BMP since 
it's a naff format in my opinion and tied to the Windows platform anyway. Ogre 
supports JPEG, PNG and TGA which should be plenty of flexibility. Personally I 
think when you've got PNG (for lossless) and JPEG (for lossy), you don't need 
anything else.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">10 August 2001</p><p>Texture 
blending is now in and working! The new TestApp demonstrates the functionality 
by loading a base model with a standard texture, then adding a second texture 
layer and applying an environment map to it. The keys 0-7 change the texture blending 
mode to show what effects different parameters have.</p><p>I'm now moving onto 
other features; I want to look at Quake3 file loading - there are a couple of 
things nagging me about managing materials and entities that I'd like to look 
at but I'd really like to get started on Q3A bsp files now. I also wanted to work 
on animation, both within models (skeletal animation &amp; bones) and for paths 
of objects (bezier curves &amp; bsplines), but I just don't have time to do everything 
I want to! Q3A files first.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">5 August 2001</p><p>Back 
from a break for holidays!</p><p>The Camera class now allows a SceneNode to override 
it's position and orientation when the Camera is attached to a SceneNode. This 
will allow cameras attached to world objects etc.</p><p>Started implementing the 
texture blending operations - the interface is complete, I'm now moving onto the 
Direct3D implementation. For the moment I'm not worrying about minimising the 
number of times that changes to blending parameters are made during a frame - 
I'm still concentrating on minimising the texture changes, which is the main overhead 
anyway. More optimisation will likely come along with new SceneManager subclasses.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">21 
July 2001</p><p>The Camera class now uses quaternions too. Camera rotation is 
a lot more concise now (instead of storing &amp; trying to update 3 vectors I 
just have a single quaternion) and is more predictable and hopefully more flexible 
for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>You can attach a Camera to a SceneNode (this is meant 
for use in having cameras tracking other objects in the world) but I have yet 
to implement this - I intend now that they're both on the same basis that if you 
choose to attach a camera to a scene node then the SceneNode overrides the camera's 
own position and direction, and maybe even that they update each other (so telling 
a camera to look somewhere would update the orientation of it's SceneNode too).</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">19 
July 2001</p><p>Updated SceneNode class to use quaternions internally for all 
orientations / rotations. This should both be faster and give me more flexibility 
for the future. Also added a lot more manipulation routines the SceneNode class 
which were sorely lacking before if you wanted to move stuff around. The Camera 
class still uses matrices internally but I intend to change that so that a Camera 
depends on the SceneNode it is attached to for positioning rather than doing it 
itself. To this end I will need to add extra features to the SceneNode class to 
replicate functions like lookAt(), which is ok since this will be handy for pointing 
other objects at each other too.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader"></p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">17 
July 2001</p><p>Fixed an issue with the 3ds2oof utility - it now generates vertex 
normals based on smooth groups rather than just averaging based on the faces which 
use the vertex. This removes artefacts along model 'seams' e.g. the point where 
a texture wraps around on the model.</p><p>Reimplemented environment mapping using 
the new Material::TextureLayer structure. Started work on adding more manipulation 
features to the SceneNode class (body code still to do).</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">4 
July 2001</p><p>Python now has full access to the engine, and it's working great. 
I've also enabled callbacks into Python from the engine, so you can register a 
Python class as a listener for frame update events so C++ calls Python every frame. 
Nice.</p><p>Future Python developments include an embedded version of Python in 
Ogre so you can build a compiled application which still used interpreted scripts 
for some things - this will be useful for level scripting etc where the script 
can be kept in the level data. For now though I'm going back to developing the 
core engine features .</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">20 June 2001</p><p>Spending 
an awful lot of time exposing all the necessary objects and their interfaces to 
Python (up till now I have it working but only a few interfaces were exposed). 
About 90% there now, with a few issues to iron out - I had to extend the compiler 
heap limit to get it to compile so far since the heavy usage of templates puts 
a great strain on the compiler memory usage. In a few days I should be in a position 
to do all my engine testing through Python as well as through a custom C++ application 
(currently TestApp). </p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">13 June 2001</p><p>Added 
FrameListener and FrameEvent classes in order to represent the frame update callback 
functions in a more object-oriented way. User applications now extend FrameListener 
and register their interest in receiving frame events - this is based on the Java 
model of event listening. Note that a boon of this method is that Boost Python 
allows you to extend existing C++ classes so this provides a perfect mechanism 
to have C++ call Python scripts when events occur. </p><p>I intend to extend this 
pattern to other events like collisions when I implement them. </p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">10 
June 2001</p><p align="left">Changed from using SWIG to Boost Python for Python 
script integration<a href="http://boost.org"></a>. I changed because Boost Python 
supports C++ features much beter (including catching C++ exceptions and turning 
them into Python exceptions, support for namespaces and overloaded operators), 
it integrates better with my build cycle (doesn't require a separate generate 
from interface files and can be built directly into the library), and is more 
up-to-date with the latest Python libraries. I was finding that SWIG's emphasis 
on pure C as opposed to C++ was getting in the way, and Boost has definitely addressed 
this.</p><p align="left">Introduced PythonLink class to expose classes to Python.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">7 
June 2001</p><p align="left">Implemented Python integration using SWIG (Simplified 
Wrapper and Interface Generator). You can now start and initialise Ogre from a 
Python console and drive it interactively. More work required to expose the full 
interface to Python however.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">31 May 2001</p><p align="left">Cut 
over to CVS - CVS repository is now up and running at SourceForge.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">20 
May 2001</p><p align="left">SceneNode class integrated with Entity / SubEntity 
classes. Working basic scene graph. Also reimplemented my previous hack using 
DirectInput as a proper platform-specific user input class - added the OgreUtility 
module for this purpose.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">15 May 2001</p><p align="left">SubEntity 
implementation complete, together with customisable Materials at the SubEntity 
level. Material usage by SubEntities is now indexed by the SceneManager so that 
rendering can be grouped by Material such that as few as possible render state 
changes take place. Note that this does not currently deal with transparency.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">13 
May 2001</p><p align="left">Bugs with the new Mesh loading routines now ironed 
out.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">24 April 2001</p><p align="left">Implemented 
Mesh, SubMesh and MeshManager classes for loading Ogre Object Format files (converted 
from .3ds using the Ogre 3ds2oof tool). Decided to allow the original 3ds mesh 
to be broken down into chunks specific per material or grouped as a whole depending 
on requirements. The 3ds2oof utility makes a goos guess as to what is best, based 
on the percentage of the vertices each SubMesh uses out of the whole model - the 
lower the percentage the greater chance it will have a dedicated vertex list rather 
than sharing the whole since that saves sending unnecessary vertices to the pipeline. 
However this can be customised with parameters since you may want to use vertex 
buffers where it's more efficient to store 1 buffer even if you only use parts 
of it.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">1 April 2001</p><p align="left">Began 
overhaul of Mesh loading routines.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">30 March 
2001</p><p align="left">Switched to Doxygen for document generation since ccdoc 
still doesn't support namespaces. Doxygen is better at cross-referencing anyway 
and draws nice diagrams.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">24 March 2001</p><p align="left">Added 
JPEG loading support, and moved this and existing image loading code (PNG) into 
the Image class. BMP loading is still supported but only on Windows platforms 
so this is still residing in the D3DTexture class as a special case.</p><p align="left">Improved 
the handling of non-square textures on hardware that supports only square textures. 
The image is now stretched into the square area so that the relative texture coordinates 
are still valid and no black bands appear on the model.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">23 
March 2001</p><p align="left">Multiple viewports per window is implemented and 
working Ok. Z-Order also applies so picture-in-picture views are possible by placing 
a smaller viewport on top of another larger one.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">11 
March 2001</p><p align="left">Changed the default mechanism for supplying vertex 
components (position, normals, texture coords, colours) to the RenderOperation 
class. They were previously assumed to be part of the same buffer with flags indicating 
which were present. However this was too restrictive and prevented you using entirely 
separate memory areas for different components, and adding extra components to 
vertices on the fly. </p><p align="left">Instead the RenderOperation class now 
takes pointers for each component, and a 'span' value determines the gap between 
each value. This allows you to use separate buffers if you like, but also use 
a combined buffer if that suits you (by using the 'span' value to skip over values 
in between).</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">6 March 2001</p><p align="left">Implemented 
a 3DStudio conversion tool that works directly from the .3DS files rather than 
from ASCII exports (as previously) or from a MAX plugin as some others do, which 
requires a 3DS license. I based my code on an existing open source routine but 
I have exteded it since it had a few shortcomings. The tool is called '3ds2oof' 
because it converts 3DS files to a proprietary format, .OOF (Ogre Object File). 
This is because it's more efficient for me to do extra processing at conversion 
time like calculating bounding boxes, splitting vertex buffers, strippifying etc 
(not that I'm doing all this yet, but I <i>can</i>) rather than at load time as 
I would have to do if I loaded direct from 3DS inside Ogre.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">1 
March 2001</p><p align="left">Over the last 2 weeks I reimplemented my interface 
to the DirectX rendering pipeline in the new Ogre structure, under the D3DRenderSystem 
class. Rendering requests are now packaged up in the RenderOperation class, giving 
me more flexibility on how rendering requests are submitted and handled. Now all 
the support classes (mesh loading, scene management) are needed.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">11 
February 2001</p><p align="left">I've been picking apart the platform dependencies 
in Ogre so it'll be more portable. I'm also making it flexible enough to handle 
any number of rendering windows and viewports within thse windows, and also giving 
you the choice of an automatic rendering loop (max frame rate) and a render-on-demand 
interface much like you would need for an application like a modelling tool where 
you want to free up cycles when things don't move and frae rate isn't the most 
important thing.</p><p align="left">I now have a nice hierarchy crossing the OgreEngine 
and OgreWin32Platform modules, with functionality broken down into RenderTarget, 
RenderWindow and Win32RenderWindow classes. Other platforms can be implemented 
later, just replacing the Win32RenderWindow maybe with XRenderWindow or MacRenderWindow.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">29 
December 2000</p><p align="left">Ogre development starts again after almost a 
year's break while I finished my degree. Lots of research and design work at this 
stage to work out how I should structure the object model.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
