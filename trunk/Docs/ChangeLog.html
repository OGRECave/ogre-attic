<p class="header" align="center">Change Log</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">v1.0.3 [Azathoth] (10 July
2005) - Maintenance Release</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a problem in D3D9 where GeForce 6x00 range was not enabling infinite projection</li>
  <li>libOgreMain.so now only exports symbols based on ogremain.map</li>
  <li>Fixed --enable-openexr argument for ./configure</li>
  <li>XSI exporter - don't crash if textures are not found, just warn
instead.&nbsp; Also trap cases where too many texture coordinate sets
are used and warn.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Last of D3D9 leaks removed</li>
  <li>Extra logging for D3D9 device lost / restore process</li>
  <li>Fix device restore of RTT in D3D9</li>
  <li>Replace SDL hard-coded constant args for SDL_ShowMouse</li>
  <li>Make RenderWindow::windowMovedOrResized virtual &amp; generalised
from GL/D3D since they're useful for people with externally managed
windows</li>
  <li>Corrected type of the returned value from
std::string::find_first_of and find_first_not_of</li>
  <li>Allow external setting of BillboardSet bounds for billboard
injection</li>
  <li>Q3A level loader - reject lightmap indexes &lt; 0, not just -1,
for greater level compatibility</li>
  <li>Export TagPoint to allow post attach-to-bone modifications</li>
  <li>Set ambient light settings per _renderScene call incase we switch
contexts in GL</li>
  <li>gcc 4.0 compatibility and removed the need for GCC_3_1 compiler
flag<br>

  <li>Fix to AnimationTrack::optimise - we should not eliminate all
duplicate keys since the boundary values are required to preserve the
interpolation shape. In fact, we need to preserve sequences of up to no
more than 4 identical keys to preserve tangents for if spline
interpolation is used. Any inner ones are removed.</li>
  <li>Matrix4::operator != should take a const reference parameter</li>
  <li>Node::removeAllChildren should notify those children of

<p class="mainheader" align="left">v1.0.0 RC1 [Azathoth] (5 February
2005) - Major Release</p>
<p>1.0.0 is a big release, and due to us wanting to freeze interfaces
at the best possible level for 1.0.0 there are more interface
breaking changes in 1.0.0 than is typical for previous releases. For
the full lowdown on upgrading your code from Hastur (0.15.x) to
Azathoth (1.0.x) , please see the <a
 href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/AzathothNotes">Azathoth
Porting Notes Wiki Page</a>. </p>
<p align="left">Enhancements and new Features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff33">Resource
System Overhaul</font>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Resources now addressed through
shared pointers </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Resource groups can now be
defined so that you can load and unload resources in groups, and also
set up group-specific search paths and scripting tasks. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Manual resource provision
formalised; there is now a ManualLoader class that should be
implemented when creating resources in code; this allows resource
reloads to be possible in all cases </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Streaming support - data is now
accessed from Ogre's virtual file system solely through the DataStream
class (and subclasses), meaning that accessing very large files
efficiently is now possible while still using the resource system. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Loading progress reports; you
can now register ResourceGroupListeners in order to implement loading
bars </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Thread safety - steps have been
taked to make the resource system thread-safe to allow background
loading. This feature is experimental and should only be used by
experienced users. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff33">Hardware Pixel
Buffers &amp; Image enhancements</font>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Direct access to read / write to
texture surfaces through the HardwarePixelBuffer class, including mip
levels, cube surfaces and volume slices </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Pixel formats have been
extended, are now unambiguous across endianness, having separate
'native' endian formats and per-byte formats </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Support for floating-point pixel
formats, luminence formats, depth formats, and compressed formats </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Image class has been tidied and
enhanced to support composite images (like cube maps) </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">PixelUtil class now provides
access to all pixel format conversion functions, with optimised
templated conversion routines available in capable compilers </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff33">High Dynamic
Range (HDR) rendering support</font>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Create render textures in
floating-point pixel formats </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Load .hdr or .exr textures from
disk using the OpenEXR plugin (optional) </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff33">Particle
System enhancements</font>: Particle systems are no longer limited to
rendering with billboards, they render through instances of
ParticleSystemRenderer subclasses, which can be implemented in plugins
and added at runtime. Use of these alternative renderers is scriptable
and can be used to implement alternative particle types like ribbons. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff33">GUI changes</font>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The OGRE internal GUI has been
replaced with <a href="http://www.cegui.org.uk/">Crazy Eddie's GUI</a>,
a superior GUI system which follows the same kind of design principles
as Ogre itself (portable, clean OO code). </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Non-interactive overlays remain
within OGRE itself, the classes have been renamed *OverlayElement
instead of *GuiElement to reflect their role </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Material changes: </p>

from the texture_unit to the pass </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Linking vertex colours to
material attributes; you can now link vertex colours to any of the
diffuse, specular, emissive or ambient material attribures, (e.g.
'ambient vertexcolour') rather than the linkage being implicit. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">You can now define the number of
mipmaps to be generated when loading a texture in the material script,
from '0' to 'unlimited' </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">New StaticGeometry class allows you
to batch up individual meshes and render thousands of them far more
efficiently than if they were separate movable objects </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">GL now supports render textures
larger than the frame buffer (through pbuffers) </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">D3D9 uses best possible filter
method supported by hardware for generating Mipmaps, this can improve
display quality especially when using trilinear filtering </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Support all image types that DevIL
can load: bmp, gif, hdr, ico, jpeg, pnm, mng and many more </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Better support for 3D and compressed
textures </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">New and improved demos: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">'DynTex' shows how to
procedurally generate textures using the new pixel buffer API </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">'VolumeTex' demonstrates volume

<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.15.0 [Hastur] (23 October 2004) -
Major Release</p>
<p align="left">Note: Ogre development branches will now have code
names; the 0.15 stable branch is known as 'Hastur', the continuing
development branch (which will be released as 1.0) is called
'Azathoth'. </p>
<p align="left">Enhancements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff33">Binary mesh
format enhanced</font>. Previously the binary mesh format did not
support all the flexibility you could attain when you built meshes
programmatically. This has been addressed, and the mesh can now store
arbitrary vertex buffer formats, precomputed edge lists (for stencil
shadows), and tangent-space vectors (for normal mapping). You are
strongly adviced to use the OgreMeshUpgrade tool on all your meshes to
uprade them to the latest version, and choose 'y' when asked if you
want to reorganise your vertex buffers. The 'automatic' option is the
quickest way to get your meshes up to date, and you may find them
slightly faster to render as a result. <br>
Bear in mind that the .mesh size will increase because edge lists are
precomputed and stored by default - if you don't intend to use stencil
shadows then you can disable this with the '-e' parameter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff33">OpenGL Shading
Language (GLSL) support</font>. This means Ogre now supports
programmable shaders written in Cg, HLSL, GLSL and all variants of
assembler (DirectX and GL). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff33">Explicit
Radian, Degree and AngleUnit classes</font>. To resolve ambiguity as to
which angle unit is being used, all methods which take an angle now
take a Radian class. You can pass Degree instances to this too and get
automatic degree-to-radian conversion. You can also use the AngleUnit
class which defaults to the current angle units (see Math). Note that
conversions are inlined and are thus very cheap; although if you want
to avoid them entirely, use Radian. This is an <font color="#ff6600">interface
breaking change</font>, so you will need to update your code to use
Radian(radianValue) or Degree(degreeValue) where you are using basic
types to store angles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff00">Reflection
enhancements</font>. Automatic reflections using dynamic planes are now
simple to create using MovablePlane, and 'custom near clip planes'
(oblique depth projection) are available to allow you to clip reflected
geometry to an arbitrary plane without requiring additional hardware
support such as user clip planes. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Per-Renderable custom parameters can
now be mapped into vertex / fragment programs (using ACT_CUSTOM) to
better customise the look of your programmably shaded objects</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Skeletal animation optimisation: by
default it now uses an approximation of true rotational interpolation
which is slightly faster; true spherical interpolation is still an
option if more accuracy is required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Edge list improvements; Ogre can now
deal with even more model construction variants while still retaining
stencil shadow integrity </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Billboard / particle system index
and vertex buffers are now deferred loading </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Blender and Milkshape exporters
updated </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">GL now has a FSAA option like D3D </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Specialised scene queries for the
OctreeSceneManager </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Mesh bounds padding is now more
configurable </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Skeleton instances can now be shared
between multiple entities to allow optional add-ons to animated meshes </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Transparent materials can now cast
texture shadows, if an option is enabled in their material (useful for
alpha rejection textures) </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added <font color="#ffff33">GLX</font> platform manager,
enabling the use of OGRE on Linux without using SDL. This also has a
nice configuration dialog instead of the text based one. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Ogre::String is no longer a subclass
of std::string, but a typedef to it. All extra methods which were on
Ogre::String are now on the Ogre::StringUtil class. This is to resolve
compatibility issues on some STLs; this is an <font color="#ff6600">interface
breaking change</font> so you will need to update your code to use the
equivalent StringUtil methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">DirectX no longer prefers W buffers
over Z buffers unless 16-bit colour is being used </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">DirectInput usage now plays nicer
with other apps </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Fixed the number of textures used
when a custom number of shadow textures were specified </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Fixed TS_PARENT and TS_WORLD Node
transform options </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Fixed LBX_BLEND_MANUAL in GL </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Fixed finding of nearby lights so it
takes into account bounds of node </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Avoided ATI shutdown issues in
GL/Linux by making the shutdown sequence more explicit </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Initialisation of shadow materials
now works when more than one SceneManager is active </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Some frustum calculation issues were
resolved, especially calculation of corners and planes in orthographic
mode </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">use32bitindexes was not being read
from XML correctly </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Fixed memory leak when attaching and
detaching objects from bones </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Stencil shadows were not working
correctly when 2-sided stencilling was not available and there was more
than one SubMesh with it's own geometry </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Various other minor issues</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Deprecation warnings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff33">SceneNode::attachCamera
and SceneNode::attachLight</font>, which have been deprecated for some
time, have been removed. Use SceneNode::attachObject.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff33">Internal GUI
classes</font>; in the next release, the internal GUI will be removed
in favour of <a href="http://crayzedsgui.sourceforge.net/">Crazy
Eddie's GUI</a>, and we advise all users to begin migrating their code
now. This covers the interactive GUIs (ie buttons, scroll bars etc) and
not static overlays, which will still be available in Ogre. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><font color="#ffff33">NatureSceneManager</font>; this will be
moved to ogreaddons in the next version incase anyone wishes to
continue to maintain it. The Ogre team have no plans to support this
scene manager since TerrainSceneManager and PagingLandscape (in
ogreaddons) provide better terrain rendering options.</p>

This allow it to deal with multiple capped submeshes with their own
geometry (which are manifold in themselves) even if they touch at the
boundaries. At the same time it still deals with the case where a model
is only manifold when all submeshes are combined (it tries to find this
case first).</p>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.14.0 (12 May 2004) - Major
Release</p>
<p align="left">Enhancements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><font color="#ffff33">Shadows</font></b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">3 different techniques: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Modulative stencil shadows
(simple extra pass darkens the shadowed areas) </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Additive stencil shadows
(masking of light contribution, aka Doom3-style, including a smart pass
categoriser / splitter which means you don't need to rewrite your
materials) </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Modulative projective
texture shadows </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Multiple stencil shadow
optimisations, including vertex program extrusion, smart light and
shadow caster culling, integration with mesh LOD, zpass and zfail
methods, 2-sided stencilling, scissor region clipping </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Texture shadows fade out at the
far distance and around the edges of spotlight, hiding the finite edges
of these shadow types</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Important: Those writing custom SceneManager implementations
will have to review the changes to the render queues and render
sequence when shadows are enabled, since supporting several types of
shadows has required these processes to be significantly enhanced and
decomposed into multiple parts (which should lend themselves to
customisation in your SMs if you need them). In particular, note that
the signature of SceneManager::_findVisibleObjects has changed so if
you override this you will need to alter yours too - the compiler will
not tell you about this!</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><font color="#ffff33">Hardware
Skinning</font></b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Skeletal animation can now be
driven using vertex programs </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Number of bones limited only by
your target vertex program version</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><font color="#ffff33">General
purpose projective texturing</font></b>. Projective texturing was
possible in Ogre before, but it required you to manually set up the
texture matrices. Now there is a simple 1-method call which allows you
to link a texture unit to a Frustum instance, and it will automatically
sync the projection of the texture with changes to the frustum. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><font color="#ffff33">Node/SceneNode
enhancements</font></b>. You can now make a node automatically track
(constantly look at) another node, and all transforms now take a
'transform space' parameter to make it easier to perform
transformations relative to any space. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><font color="#ffff33">Skeleton
instances</font></b>. The sharing of skeletons between multiple
animated objects has been made more flexible so that you can now more
easily hook up external effects on the bones on particular instances of
that skeleton (in entities); applications such as manually controlling
bones or ragdoll simulations benefit from these enhancements. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><font color="#ffff33">External
Texture Sources</font></b>. You can now register external texture
sources in order to feed texture data in from another source; this has
been used to render video through a texture for example, although the
technique can be used for many other things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Updated GTK demo showing you how to
embed an Ogre window in a GTK application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Added an offset (parallax) mapping
example to the Dot3Bump demo, along with a normal mapped statue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Mac OSX now supports Cg so the
plugin has been enabled</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Introduced the Frustum class as a
superclass of Camera, abstracting many of the features so they can be
reused in other situations like texture projection. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Updated Blender and Lightwave
exporters </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">SubEntities can now have their
visibility toggled individually </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Hardware occlusion query support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Animation looping can now be disabled on AnimationState</p>
  </li>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.13.1 (1 March 2004) - Maintenance
Release</p>
<p align="left">Enhancements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Updated Blender exporter, now includes a GUI and full skeletal
animation support</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Removed redundant
Demo_TechDemo.vcproj link from Ogre.sln </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Removed the forced normal
normalisation code from the D3D renderers, it is not required so long
as the models have unit-length normals, and this is now fixable on a
per-Entity basis. Including this code in the render system caused some
state management problems with SceneManager. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">D3D7 now correctly records all
capabilities (inc cubemapping, anisotropy) </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Fixed a bug with multiple
attachments of objects to bones. Previously attached objects were not
always properly visible and/or did not move correctly. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Fixed a crash bug with ConfigFile
when an empty value was specified </p>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.13.0 (18 January 2004) - Major
Release</p>
<p align="left">Changes since 0.12.3:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><font color="#ffff00">Major
material upgrade</font></b>! This is a subsection of it's own.. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Support for <font
 color="#ffff00">vertex and fragment programs</font> (shaders),
including: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff00">Low-level
assembler programs</font> under D3D9 (vs_1_1, vs_2_x, ps_1_x, ps_2_x)
and GL (NV_texture_shader, NV_register_combiners, arbvp1, arbfp1,
ATI_fragment_shader) </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff00">High-level
program support</font> via plugins, so far we support Cg and D3D9 HLSL.
Cg compiles down to D3D and GL assembler, and includes converters to
non-assembler formats including NV_register_combiners and
ATI_fragment_shader so you can write a single program for all targets. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Support for automatically
updated parameter bindings such as 'object space camera position',
'object space light direction' and many more </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Programs can be defined and
reused many times with different parameters, all through .material
scripts </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Materials now support <font
 color="#ffff00">multiple 'techniques'</font>, which can be used as
automatic fallbacks for older cards which don't support the requisite
features for your preferred shading approach</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff00">Material
LOD</font> - you can tell materials to change technique over distance
to save rendering power on distant objects; this is subject to the same
control parameters (camera bias and entity bias) that is used for mesh
LOD so you can tweak it heavily </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#ffff00">Scriptable
multipass rendering</font>; you can now specify multiple passes in one
material if you wish, and those passes can also be iterated once per
light automatically, and the engine will call the pass with each nearby
light </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The .material script format has
been extensively upgraded to handle all these new options; however if
you have 0.12.x or previous scripts you can automatically update them
using the OgreMaterialUpgrade tool </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><font color="#ffff00">Light
management upgraded</font></b>; you can now have an unlimited number of
lights in the scene, and OGRE will pick and use the 'n' closest lights
('n' is configurable per pass in the material scripts) which are within
their attenuation range when rendering an object. This makes light
management much more practical, especially when using vertex and
fragment programs. As mentioned above, passes can even be configured to
iterate using the 'n' nearest lights. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><font color="#ffff00">More
texture formats supported</font></b>: we now support <font
 color="#ffff00">1D</font> textures, <font color="#ffff00">compressed
textures</font> (DXT formats), <font color="#ffff00">volume textures</font>
(true 3D textures, not just 6 faces like cube maps), and loading all of
the above from the <font color="#ffff00">.dds format</font>, even in
GL. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><font color="#ffff00">XCode </font></b>IDE
support on Mac OSX</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Precompiled header support on VC6
and VC7, this makes compilation a lot faster. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Updated 3DS and Maya exporters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Frame events can now be raised
externally, which makes it easier to update the internal state of
particle systems, controllers et al when you're running your own
rendering loop instead of using Root::startRendering. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Texture filtering can now be
controlled more finely by optionally setting the min, mag an mip filter
instead of one abstracted filter type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Fonts now look cleaner, texture size
has been optimised and filtering tuned </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 'v' texture coordinate has been flipped so that the origin
is now in the top-left, this removes the need to flip textures and
improves loading times as well as making compressed texture support
feasible. The .mesh format will be converted on the fly automatically,
but you should use OgreMeshUpgrade to fix it permanently </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.12.0 (23 September 2003) - Major
Release </p>
<p align="left">Changes since 0.11.0:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Complete overhaul of core geometry
usage resulting in optimised use of hardware vertex and index buffers,
providing significant speed boosts on all cards, typically of between
50 and 200% depending on the application. ATI 9500+ cards on DirectX9
will see particularly large increases (often five-fold) due to their
particular affinity to this approach. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Geometry structures redesigned to
support the above and also to provide the basis for vertex and pixel
shaders. This will not affect you unless you manipulated geometry
structures such as the old GeometryData directly - those who did <a
 href="vbo-update/index.html">should read about the details of the
changes</a>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Transparent materials no longer
assume that depth writing needs to be off, this setting was causing
some problems with those using alpha blending. Those of you using
transparent materials which do need depth writing to be turned off will
need to set it in your material scripts </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">DirectX 8 rendersystem retired, the
current DirectX rendersystem is now DirectX9, with legacy cards
supported through the DirectX7 rendersystem or OpenGL </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Support for cubic textures and cubic
reflection mapping added </p>

  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Support for DOT3 bump mapping added </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Significant speed improvements on
rebuilding bezier patch surfaces, changing detail level is now a lot
faster </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Binary .mesh format updated - please
run 'OgreMeshUpgrade' (from Tools/MeshUpgrader) on your old meshes,
they may not work properly unless you do this </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">OgreXmlConverter now includes
parameters to allow you to generate LODs as you convert </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Mesh serializer now rationalises
bone assignments so that only 4 are included per vertex </p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.11.0 (18 June 2003)</p>
<p align="left">Changes since 0.10.0:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">SceneQuery introduced; a generic way
to query the SceneManager database of objects and world geometry in a
way which is optimised per scene management technique but transparent
for the client application. Currently only IntersectionSceneQuery is
implemented but RaySceneQuery, SphereSceneQuery and others will soon be
available too </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">ReferenceApplication introduced;
this is a new library which sits on top of the main OGRE library in
order to provide a reference implementation of combining OGRE with
other libraries for use in a full application. Currently combines OGRE
and ODE to provide an easy to use collision and realistic physics
system, utilising the new SceneQuery functions for generic collision
detection. Object to object collision is currently supported, together
this object to world collision for the BspSceneManager (ie collision
against Quake3 levels), see the BspCollision demo for an example.
Per-object friction, bounciness and mass parameters are all definable,
also most of the ODE joint types ie ball, hinge, hinge2, universal.
World collision for the terrain managers will be added shortly. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Many structural enhancements to the
GLRenderSystem, including an extension manager, separation of window
creation etc into a GLSupport class (to enable platform specific window
management). Win32GLSupport added so Win32 no longer uses SDL for
window management. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Hardware mipmap generation supported
in GL 1.3+ </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">New demos: BspCollision and
Demo_Water </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">RenderTargetListener now supports
pre and post Viewport update events </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">RenderSystem now supports
anisotropic texture filtering and dot3 texture operations </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Significant updates to the 3D Studio
Max exporter, now very mature </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Added 3 more basic mesh exporters /
converters: Maya, Wings3D and VRML 97 </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Attaching objects to a skeleton: any
MovableObject (entities, particle systems etc) can now be attached to
any bone on an entity, and will move correctly with the animation </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">XMLConverter can now generate /

  </li>
</ul>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.98b (29 March 2002)</p>
<p align="left">Changes since 0.97e:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Material scripts. All materials can
now be specified in .material files, which are loaded at startup and
can be altered without recompiling your application. Tweak to your
hearts content! See the material scripting section in the Tutorials for
more information. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Landscape rendering - a ROAM scene
manager example implementation is now included in the distribution,
together with an example demo. Whilst the ROAM approach will not be
developed further due to it's relatively high CPU overhead, it serves
as an example of how vastly different scene managers can be plugged
into Ogre. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Billboarding. Billboards can now be
used to create special effects. Particle systems using this facility
are under development. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Better culling on the standard scene
manager. The standard non-scene-specific scene manager now
hierarchically culls movables based on their bounding boxes. A triangle
counter monitors culling performance. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Refactored the methods called in the
main rendering loop in SceneManager to allow subclasses to modify the
behaviour more easily without having to duplicate code. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better compliance with STL standards. Ogre is now built using <a
 href="http://www.stlport.org/">STLport</a> on both Windows and Linux,
and this has necessitated a closer fit with the STL standard rather
than the Microsoft implementation. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.97e (16 Feb 2002)</p>
<p>Changes since 0.97b:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Archive driver system is in! Say
bye-bye to the Ogre::Archive class and welcome to dynamically-loaded
archive codecs! </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Two archive codecs are provided:
FileSystem codec (works like a normal directory) and Zip Archive codec
(works with Zip archives) </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Changed all examples and the Indoor
Engine to work with the new codecs </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Modified the way
ResourceManager::_findResourceData returns data: now it takes a pointer
to a DataChunk and fills the pointed object with all the data, thus
avoiding unnecesary memory copying (and eventually fragmentation) </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Some cosmetic changes to the way
plug-ins are loaded - no need to specify the extension of the plug-in
anymore, and it is registered as given in the Plugins.cfg file. This is
because we don't want to load a Dll two times - the first time as
[PluginPath]\PluginName.dll and the second time as plain PluginName </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Cosmetic changes in projects and
workspaces. They should give no error when compiling and you shouldn't
need to create the necessary directories yourselves </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Resources folder has changed. The two .oof models and their
textures now reside in zip archives to reflect the usage of the new
Archive codecs. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.97b (6 Feb 2002)</p>
<p align="left">Changes since 0.96b:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Added some more standard Controller
objects to allow easy texture scrolling, rotating and scaling. Added
support for these to the Quake3 renderer . </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Wave-based controllers allow texture
modifications (among other things) to be based on wave types rather
than just constant effects </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Added more friendly error dialog
when an unhandled exception is thrown </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Fixed a couple of bugs in the config
dialog which causes crashes </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fogging enabled - scene-wide or customised per material </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.96b (6 January 2002)</p>
<p align="left">I've changed this log a little to be more concise
regarding changes made between snapshot versions. </p>
<p align="left">Changes since 0.95b:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Animated tetxure support. Each
texture layer can have multiple frames, with one being active at a
time. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Controller architecture. Controller
allow object properties to be updated based on other events or values
whilst only loosely coupling the source and destination objects
together. In this version Controllers are used for animating texture
layers by setting the active texture frame based on a frame timer
object. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Quake 3 .shader script support.
Animated textures, multilayer textures etc now being loaded in. No
scrolling, rotating or stretching effects yet though </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Skyplanes, skydomes and skyboxes are
now supported </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Major improvement in rendering speed
thanks to a far smarter render state management approach. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transparent objects now always render correctly when in front of
solid objects. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">6 January 2002</p>
<p align="left">Most bugs in shader parsing sorted out. A few shader
effects are not supported yet, but most are there and look good.
Texture coordinate modifications are missing for the moment, but
environment mapping is in (albeit a little different from Q3A's
method - I chose to use cameraspace reflection vectors to produce the
effect because these are hardware accelerable, whilst Q3A's method of
using the vector from camera location to vertex is not), as are all
the shafts of light, animated flames etc.</p>
<p align="left">No MD3 models are being rendered so there are a few
blank spots in the level where a gargoyle, wall sconce etc should be.
I'm not going to implement this for now, I've proved the point I
wanted to prove which is that Ogre can handle this type of scene
well. It's just a few Q3-specific details which are missing which is
no big deal, I never set out to produce a working copy of Q3A.</p>
<p align="left">I will be releasing another snapshot based on this
codebase, and also will release binary demos of all the examples.</p>
<p align="left">Next: texture coordinate modifications, extensions to
the controller classes. Then particle systems. </p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">5 January 2002</p>
<p align="left">Skydomes and skyboxes are in and working, giving you 3
types of sky to play with. Skyboxes are for static, wrap-around
environment textures like space, whilst skydomes are like skyplanes,
but curved.</p>
<p align="left">Quake3 shader script conversion is going well, Ogre
loads in the .shader files and converts them to Material objects as
required, meaning that you can now see flames, shafts of light, TV
screens etc inside Ogre. Animated textures are being loaded but not
animated yet - I'm going to try and get animation working within a
nice generic OO controller framework if I can rather than bash out a
single-use approach.</p>
<p align="left">One thing I've noticed now the sky is being displayed
is there are 'sparklies' around the curved surfaces visible mostly
when there is a light-coloured sky. Damn. It appears the points
generated from the bezier patches don't quite match up with the
surrounding static geometry, meaning there are small gaps. This is a
TODO.</p>
<p align="left">I still need to fix the odd crash point and a few
shaders aren't being loaded properly. Also environment mapping needs
a bit of work since Quake3 bases them on camera position -&gt; vertex
rather than camera eye vector -&gt; normal, which means they look
wrong. I should alos render the 'models' in the level i.e. geometry
that doesn't have lightmaps like gargoyles.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">27 December 2001</p>
<p align="left">Skyplanes are now working. You can now create a plane
which is at contant distance from the camera at and orientation for
use as a sky. I'll be moving on to skyboxes imminently which will
allow full wrap-around skies.</p>
<p align="left">I have also totally revamped the example code that is
included with the engine. Instead of the single TestApp project,
there is now an Examples folder with multiple projects under this
which demo each effect. I have also created an object-oriented
framework for the examples too, meaning they are now a lot better
structured and hopefully better to understand.</p>
<p align="left">I also intend to release some binary demos soon so
people can quickly see what the engine is capable of without having
to build from the source. The good news this week is that I just did
a Release build of the Quake3 level renderer, and it runs at a very
sweet 170fps in windowed mode on my Athlon 1Ghz and GeForce 2. In
fullscreen mode at 1024x768 at 32-bit colour it still manages between
50 and 80 fps. I'm very pleased indeed. I would like to tidy up some
of the missing textures before I do a binary release so I'll be
sorting out the skybox support and other texture effects first.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">24 December 2001</p>
<p align="left">Refactored the entity rendering routines in the base
SceneManager class to make them easier to reuse in subclasses.</p>
<p align="left">Material class enhanced to contain all the other render
settings such as depth buffer parameters, culling modes, texture
filtering etc. It is now possible to drive all the rendering settings
via the Material class now so that no calls are required to the
RenderSystem class. This makes the settings more intuitive to use,
and ensures that you can have different settings per object if you
want by assigning different materials, and the SceneManager controls
the changes to the rendering settings.</p>
<p align="left">Major rewrite of SceneManager::setMaterial and added
RenderSystem::_setTextureUnitSettings (used by the former) so that
only <b>changes</b> to the material settings are sent to the
RenderSystem. This ensures that rendering state changes are minimised
and that custom settings are reset only when required. This has
improved the framerate across the board by about 50%. A further
optimisation which is still to be made is ordering the materials in
the render sequence to minimise the render state changes still
further, e.g. scheduling 2 materials that have the same layer 0
texture but different layer 1 textures next to each other.</p>
<p align="left">Started adding sky plane and sky box support to the
SceneManager class, but this is not yet functional.</p>
<p align="left">Merry Xmas!</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">4 December 2001</p>
<p align="left">General Bezier Patch support through the PatchSurface
class.</p>
<p align="left">Quake3 level loading uses curved surface support to
display Q3A's bezier curves. Custom shader scripts still to be done.</p>
<p align="left">IMPORTANT: To compile &amp; run the TestApp demo
application you will need to change line 414 of WinMainTest.cpp to
point at your Quake3Arena pak0.pk3, since I can't distribute Q3A
levels and textures for size and copyright reasons.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">11 November 2001</p>
<p>First Quake3 level rendering release. No support for shader
scripts or curved surfaces yet. </p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">12 October 2001</p>
<p>Modified the material blending routines to make it more reliable
to fall back on multipass rendering whilst preserving all the correct
effects. To do this I had to simplify the basic multitexture blending
operations which automatically fall back to multipass, and require
that the application explicitly specifies a fallback blend multipass
operation if it chooses to use the more complex blending modes which
are only available under multitexture hardware. I hope by doing this
I keep it simple for most cases (people normally use jusy ADD,
MODULATE, REPLACE or ALPHABLEND anyway) whilst still allowing
complete flexibility for those who like to tinker with the obscure
modes.</p>
<p>Decided to make another point release even without the finished
Quake3 stuff because there's so much that's useful.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">9 October 2001</p>
<p>Object/scene blending operations (as opposed to multiple texture
layer blending on the same object) support has been added, allowing
new effects like transparency.</p>
<p>I keep getting distracted from my Quake3 level work but I am
progressing - the reason why I switched to this subject is that I
realised my fallback technique to multipass rendering when not enough
multitexturing hardware was available was not correct, and in order
to be able to fix it I needed these new blending options. I'm now
wondering whether to fix the multipass fallback now I have the tools
or to leave it until later. Right now, if you use more texture layers
than the hardware supports in a single pass, things won't look right.
I'll get to it.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">6 October 2001</p>
<p>Ok, remember the problem from 16 September re texture coordinates
and confusion over whether (0,0) was the top or bottom left corner of
the texture? Well it turns out that once again Direct3D is the odd
one out, and 3DS is actually using the more common convention, i.e.
(0,0) is the <i>bottom</i> left corner. I have therefore changed the
3ds2oof routine <i>back</i> to how it was before (using 3DS UV
corrdinates directly) and am flipping the texture itself in the
Y-axis when loading it in the Direct3D texture implementation to
compensate (D3DTexture.cpp). I should have checked more thoroughly
before changing things to be in line with D3D, I should have known it
would probably be the odd one.</p>
<p>I've done this because I want Ogre to follow industry standards
(e.g. right-handed coordinates, anticlockwise vertex winding) rather
than Direct3D's viewpoint which is usually the opposite, even though
it's Direct3D I'm working on at the moment. I do this because it's
what everybody will be used to when they come from maths texts or
modelling tools, and is the same as the OpenGL approach (so the
OpenGL port should be easier than Direct3D). I just compensate inside
my Direct3D-specific classes (e.g. by flipping the Z axis, changing
the culling mode, or flipping the texture as above).</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">5 October 2001</p>
<p>Progressive updates are being made to the OgreEngineIndoor module
in CVS. Quake3 levels are being loaded and coversion is in progress.</p>
<p>I have also fixed a couple more bugs: the ColourValue class was
implementing colours a little too bright and wrapped around to black
when pure white was specified. This has been fixed. In addition, the
mipmap generation was not generating enough mipmaps under Direct3D
because D3DX ignores requests for the number of mipmaps and generates
as many as required to reduce to a 1x1 texture. This caused smaller
mipmaps to be black and thus textures would wink out at long
distances. This has been fixed.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">16 September 2001</p>
<p>Slow going due to moving house. However, fixed a problem with
texture coordinates as converted from 3DS using 3ds2oof - I just
realised that 3DS uses UV coordinates where V=0.0 is at the <i>bottom</i>
of the texture map, instead of the top as with everything else! That
explains the strange textures on some models. Fixed 3ds2oof to make
V=(1.0 - V) during the conversion. Reconvert your models!</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">29 August 2001</p>
<p>Ogre now supports loading of resources from more flexible
locations, including compressed archives (.zip and Quake3 .pk3
files). You can specify a list of search paths and archives which are
either general across the whole of Ogre or specific to a resource
type (e.g. textures, meshes).</p>
<p>I've also added support for loading TGA images as well, since
Quake3 maps use them in places. </p>
<p>I have also dropped support for BMP files. This is because I have
had to implement memory-based versions of the image decoders to
support loading from archives, and to be frank I couldn't be bothered
to implement one for BMP since it's a naff format in my opinion and
tied to the Windows platform anyway. Ogre supports JPEG, PNG and TGA
which should be plenty of flexibility. Personally I think when you've
got PNG (for lossless) and JPEG (for lossy), you don't need anything
else.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">10 August 2001</p>
<p>Texture blending is now in and working! The new TestApp
demonstrates the functionality by loading a base model with a
standard texture, then adding a second texture layer and applying an
environment map to it. The keys 0-7 change the texture blending mode
to show what effects different parameters have.</p>
<p>I'm now moving onto other features; I want to look at Quake3 file
loading - there are a couple of things nagging me about managing
materials and entities that I'd like to look at but I'd really like
to get started on Q3A bsp files now. I also wanted to work on
animation, both within models (skeletal animation &amp; bones) and
for paths of objects (bezier curves &amp; bsplines), but I just don't
have time to do everything I want to! Q3A files first.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">5 August 2001</p>
<p>Back from a break for holidays!</p>
<p>The Camera class now allows a SceneNode to override it's position
and orientation when the Camera is attached to a SceneNode. This will
allow cameras attached to world objects etc.</p>
<p>Started implementing the texture blending operations - the
interface is complete, I'm now moving onto the Direct3D
implementation. For the moment I'm not worrying about minimising the
number of times that changes to blending parameters are made during a
frame - I'm still concentrating on minimising the texture changes,
which is the main overhead anyway. More optimisation will likely come
along with new SceneManager subclasses.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">21 July 2001</p>
<p>The Camera class now uses quaternions too. Camera rotation is a
lot more concise now (instead of storing &amp; trying to update 3
vectors I just have a single quaternion) and is more predictable and
hopefully more flexible for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can attach a Camera to a SceneNode (this is meant for use in
having cameras tracking other objects in the world) but I have yet to
implement this - I intend now that they're both on the same basis
that if you choose to attach a camera to a scene node then the
SceneNode overrides the camera's own position and direction, and
maybe even that they update each other (so telling a camera to look
somewhere would update the orientation of it's SceneNode too).</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">19 July 2001</p>
<p>Updated SceneNode class to use quaternions internally for all
orientations / rotations. This should both be faster and give me more
flexibility for the future. Also added a lot more manipulation
routines the SceneNode class which were sorely lacking before if you
wanted to move stuff around. The Camera class still uses matrices
internally but I intend to change that so that a Camera depends on
the SceneNode it is attached to for positioning rather than doing it
itself. To this end I will need to add extra features to the
SceneNode class to replicate functions like lookAt(), which is ok
since this will be handy for pointing other objects at each other
too.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">17 July 2001</p>
<p>Fixed an issue with the 3ds2oof utility - it now generates vertex
normals based on smooth groups rather than just averaging based on
the faces which use the vertex. This removes artefacts along model
'seams' e.g. the point where a texture wraps around on the model.</p>
<p>Reimplemented environment mapping using the new
Material::TextureLayer structure. Started work on adding more
manipulation features to the SceneNode class (body code still to do).</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">4 July 2001</p>
<p>Python now has full access to the engine, and it's working great.
I've also enabled callbacks into Python from the engine, so you can
register a Python class as a listener for frame update events so C++
calls Python every frame. Nice.</p>
<p>Future Python developments include an embedded version of Python
in Ogre so you can build a compiled application which still used
interpreted scripts for some things - this will be useful for level
scripting etc where the script can be kept in the level data. For now
though I'm going back to developing the core engine features .</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">20 June 2001</p>
<p>Spending an awful lot of time exposing all the necessary objects
and their interfaces to Python (up till now I have it working but
only a few interfaces were exposed). About 90% there now, with a few
issues to iron out - I had to extend the compiler heap limit to get
it to compile so far since the heavy usage of templates puts a great
strain on the compiler memory usage. In a few days I should be in a
position to do all my engine testing through Python as well as
through a custom C++ application (currently TestApp). </p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">13 June 2001</p>
<p>Added FrameListener and FrameEvent classes in order to represent
the frame update callback functions in a more object-oriented way.
User applications now extend FrameListener and register their
interest in receiving frame events - this is based on the Java model
of event listening. Note that a boon of this method is that Boost
Python allows you to extend existing C++ classes so this provides a
perfect mechanism to have C++ call Python scripts when events occur. </p>
<p>I intend to extend this pattern to other events like collisions
when I implement them. </p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">10 June 2001</p>
<p align="left">Changed from using SWIG to Boost Python for Python
script integration. I changed because Boost Python supports C++
features much beter (including catching C++ exceptions and turning
them into Python exceptions, support for namespaces and overloaded
operators), it integrates better with my build cycle (doesn't require
a separate generate from interface files and can be built directly
into the library), and is more up-to-date with the latest Python
libraries. I was finding that SWIG's emphasis on pure C as opposed to
C++ was getting in the way, and Boost has definitely addressed this.</p>
<p align="left">Introduced PythonLink class to expose classes to
Python.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">7 June 2001</p>
<p align="left">Implemented Python integration using SWIG (Simplified
Wrapper and Interface Generator). You can now start and initialise
Ogre from a Python console and drive it interactively. More work
required to expose the full interface to Python however.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">31 May 2001</p>
<p align="left">Cut over to CVS - CVS repository is now up and running
at SourceForge.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">20 May 2001</p>
<p align="left">SceneNode class integrated with Entity / SubEntity
classes. Working basic scene graph. Also reimplemented my previous
hack using DirectInput as a proper platform-specific user input class
- added the OgreUtility module for this purpose.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">15 May 2001</p>
<p align="left">SubEntity implementation complete, together with
customisable Materials at the SubEntity level. Material usage by
SubEntities is now indexed by the SceneManager so that rendering can
be grouped by Material such that as few as possible render state
changes take place. Note that this does not currently deal with
transparency.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">13 May 2001</p>
<p align="left">Bugs with the new Mesh loading routines now ironed out.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">24 April 2001</p>
<p align="left">Implemented Mesh, SubMesh and MeshManager classes for
loading Ogre Object Format files (converted from .3ds using the Ogre
3ds2oof tool). Decided to allow the original 3ds mesh to be broken
down into chunks specific per material or grouped as a whole
depending on requirements. The 3ds2oof utility makes a goos guess as
to what is best, based on the percentage of the vertices each SubMesh
uses out of the whole model - the lower the percentage the greater
chance it will have a dedicated vertex list rather than sharing the
whole since that saves sending unnecessary vertices to the pipeline.
However this can be customised with parameters since you may want to
use vertex buffers where it's more efficient to store 1 buffer even
if you only use parts of it.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">1 April 2001</p>
<p align="left">Began overhaul of Mesh loading routines.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">30 March 2001</p>
<p align="left">Switched to Doxygen for document generation since ccdoc
still doesn't support namespaces. Doxygen is better at
cross-referencing anyway and draws nice diagrams.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">24 March 2001</p>
<p align="left">Added JPEG loading support, and moved this and existing
image loading code (PNG) into the Image class. BMP loading is still
supported but only on Windows platforms so this is still residing in
the D3DTexture class as a special case.</p>
<p align="left">Improved the handling of non-square textures on
hardware that supports only square textures. The image is now
stretched into the square area so that the relative texture
coordinates are still valid and no black bands appear on the model.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">23 March 2001</p>
<p align="left">Multiple viewports per window is implemented and
working Ok. Z-Order also applies so picture-in-picture views are
possible by placing a smaller viewport on top of another larger one.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">11 March 2001</p>
<p align="left">Changed the default mechanism for supplying vertex
components (position, normals, texture coords, colours) to the
RenderOperation class. They were previously assumed to be part of the
same buffer with flags indicating which were present. However this
was too restrictive and prevented you using entirely separate memory
areas for different components, and adding extra components to
vertices on the fly. </p>
<p align="left">Instead the RenderOperation class now takes pointers
for each component, and a 'span' value determines the gap between
each value. This allows you to use separate buffers if you like, but
also use a combined buffer if that suits you (by using the 'span'
value to skip over values in between).</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">6 March 2001</p>
<p align="left">Implemented a 3DStudio conversion tool that works
directly from the .3DS files rather than from ASCII exports (as
previously) or from a MAX plugin as some others do, which requires a
3DS license. I based my code on an existing open source routine but I
have exteded it since it had a few shortcomings. The tool is called
'3ds2oof' because it converts 3DS files to a proprietary format, .OOF
(Ogre Object File). This is because it's more efficient for me to do
extra processing at conversion time like calculating bounding boxes,
splitting vertex buffers, strippifying etc (not that I'm doing all
this yet, but I <i>can</i>) rather than at load time as I would have
to do if I loaded direct from 3DS inside Ogre.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">1 March 2001</p>
<p align="left">Over the last 2 weeks I reimplemented my interface to
the DirectX rendering pipeline in the new Ogre structure, under the
D3DRenderSystem class. Rendering requests are now packaged up in the
RenderOperation class, giving me more flexibility on how rendering
requests are submitted and handled. Now all the support classes (mesh
loading, scene management) are needed.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">11 February 2001</p>
<p align="left">I've been picking apart the platform dependencies in
Ogre so it'll be more portable. I'm also making it flexible enough to
handle any number of rendering windows and viewports within thse
windows, and also giving you the choice of an automatic rendering
loop (max frame rate) and a render-on-demand interface much like you
would need for an application like a modelling tool where you want to
free up cycles when things don't move and frae rate isn't the most
important thing.</p>
<p align="left">I now have a nice hierarchy crossing the OgreEngine and
OgreWin32Platform modules, with functionality broken down into
RenderTarget, RenderWindow and Win32RenderWindow classes. Other
platforms can be implemented later, just replacing the
Win32RenderWindow maybe with XRenderWindow or MacRenderWindow.</p>
<p class="mainheader" align="left">29 December 2000</p>
<p align="left">Ogre development starts again after almost a year's
break while I finished my degree. Lots of research and design work at
this stage to work out how I should structure the object model.</p>
