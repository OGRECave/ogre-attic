<p class="mainheader" align="left">License Summary</p>

<p>OGRE is primarily released under an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source</a> license. You have two licensing options when using OGRE:</p>
<ul><li>Ogre&#8217;s default  license is the <a href="#LGPL">GNU  Lesser Public License (LGPL) with some specific exceptions</a>. This license is free as in beer and as in speech.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can license OGRE under a non-open source license called the <a href="#OUL">OGRE 'Unrestricted' License (OUL)</a>, for a fee.</li>
</ul>
	
<a name="LGPL"></a><p class="mainheader" align="left">LGPL (with exceptions)</p>
			
				
<p>Under  the <a href="licenses/lgpl.txt">LGPL</a> you may use Ogre for any purpose you wish, and modify it if you require, as long as you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pass on the (potentially modified) Ogre source code with your software, with original copyrights intact
<ol>
<li>If you distribute electronically, the source can be a separate download (either from your own site if you modified Ogre, or to www.ogre3d.org if you used an unmodified version) - just include a link in your documentation</li>
<li>If you distribute physical media, the Ogre source that you used to build your application should be included on that media, whether you modified it or not</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>Make it clear where you have customised it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The  above is a precis, please do read the <a href="licenses/lgpl.txt">full license text</a>. However, in order to make the use of OGRE simpler, we make exceptions / clarifications to the standard LGPL as described below.
<p><b><u>Exceptions To The LGPL For OGRE</u></b></p>
<p>The following exceptions / clarifications shall apply to the LGPL license in the case of the OGRE source code:
<ol><li>Making modifications to OGRE configuration files, build scripts and configuration headers such as OgreConfig.h in order to create a customised build setup of OGRE with the otherwise unmodified source code, does not constitute a derived work</li>
	<li>Building against OGRE headers which have inlined code does not constitute a derived work</li>
	<li>User code which subclasses OGRE classes does not form a derivative work</li>
	<li>Static linking of the unmodified OGRE libraries into a user application does not constitute a derived work, and does not require the user to pass on the source code or object code to their own application.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>


<a name="OUL"></a><p class="mainheader" align="left">OGRE 'Unrestricted' License (OUL)</p>
<p>For whatever reason some users feel that they cannot comply with, or would prefer not to comply with the conditions of the LGPL described above. Reasons might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>You wish to alter the OGRE core without releasing those changes publicly</li>
<li>Despite the quite lenient conditions of the LGPL, you are constrained by licensing policies that prevent you using an open source license</li>
</ul>
<p>To allow users with these issues to still consider using OGRE, an alternative license, the OGRE &#8220;Unrestricted&#8221; License (OUL), is available for a license fee. Thus users who have a specific need to avoid the conditions of the LGPL for their projects have the option of paying for a different license.<p><strong>If you are interested in obtaining this alternative license, please <a href="http://www.torusknot.com/contact.php">contact Torus Knot Software</a> for more details.</strong></p></blockquote>
