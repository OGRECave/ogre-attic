(Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine 
written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to 
produce games and demos utilising 3D hardware. The class library abstracts all 
the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL 
and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes.

following people are responsible for the blood, sweat and tears it took to bring 
you OGRE:</p><p><b>Steve Streeting (<a href="mailto:steve@stevestreeting.com">steve@stevestreeting.com</a>)</b></p><p>Steve 
had been thinking about creating something like OGRE since about February 2000, 
but work really started on it in 2001. Steve is responsible for the overall design, 
project management and changes to all the core functionality. He is also the main 
public contact for the project, at the above address. Steve is prone to ranting 
about why games should have the same coding and design standards as business software, 
and is based in St Peter Port, Guernsey (a small British island off the French 
coast).</p><p><b>Adrian 'cearny' Cearn&#259;u (<a href="mailto:cearny@cearny.ro">cearny@cearny.ro</a>)</b> 
</p><p>Cearny joined the project in February 2002. Cearny supplied the impetus 
and much of the implementation for switching OGRE to a completely dynamically-loaded 
library, provided the debugging memory manager, rationalised the codec system 
and has generally done a fine job of challenging my assumptions and generally 
improving the quality of the project. Cearny is based in Bucharest, Romania.</p><p><b>Thomas 
'temas' Muldowney (<a href="mailto:cearny@cearny.ro">temas@jabber.org</a>)</b></p><p>Temas 
joined the project in April 2002 and has been responsible for the Linux port and 
also generally on ANSI C++ compliance. He comes from a background of open-source 
development, and is currently a lead contributor to the Jabber open-source server 
as well as working on OGRE. He's based in Texas, USA.</p><p><b>Jon 'janders' Anderson 
(<a href="mailto:janders@users.sf.net">janders@users.sf.net</a>)</b></p><p>John 
joined the project in November 2002 and has been responsible for developing the 
OctreeSceneManager and it's subclass TerrainSceneManager, so all those rolling 
terrain shots are down to his hard work. Jon is based in Minnesota, USA.<br> </p><p><b>James 
'_mental_' O'Sullivan (<a href="mailto:janders@users.sf.net">josullivan@users.sf.net</a>)</b></p><p>_mental_ 
joined the team in May 2003 making him the most recent addition. He has spent 
his time improving OGRE's GL extension handling as well as implementing OpenGL 
1.3+ support (and fixing many versioning issues associated with that), hardware 
mipmapping (OpenGL), render to texture (OpenGL), etc. Outside of OGRE development, 
he is a full-time code monkey and FreeBSD/Linux advocate. </p><p><br> </p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">Contributing</p><p align="left">We 
welcome all contributions to OGRE, be that new plugins, bugfixes, extensions, 
tutorials, documentation, example applications, artwork or pretty much anything 
else! If you would like to contribute to the development of OGRE, please read 
the <a
 href="ContributorLicenseAgreement.html">Contributor License Agreement</a>, and 
then contact Steve Streeting at <a
 href="mailto:steve@stevestreeting.com">steve@stevestreeting.com</a> if you agree 
with the terms. </p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">Keeping Up To Date</p><p align="left">The 
best place to keep up to date with developments on OGRE is the <a href="http://ogre.sourceforge.net">Official 
Web Site</a>. From there you can download the latest source code and documentation. 
You can choose between keeping bang up to date with CVS (Concurrent Versioning 
System) or by just getting the regularly released snapshots.</p><p align="left">The 
changes included in this current version can be viewed on the <a href="ChangeLog.html"> 
ChangeLog</a>. </p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">Reporting a bug or requesting 
a feature</p><p align="left">This can be done through the Sourceforge project 
site, which you can find at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogre">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogre</a>.</p><p align="left" class="MainHeader">Licensing</p><p>OGRE

<a href="License.html">License.html</a>). In summary this means that you can use 
OGRE for any purpose, provided that if you make changes to OGRE itself, you must 
release the changes back into into the public domain under the LGPL and make it 
clear where you have made the changes. Your own application can be distributed 
under any license you like. </p><p>This program is distributed in the hope that 
it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty

addition, if you use Ogre it would be nice if you displayed the Ogre logo somewhere 
in your application (start up or shutdown) for a minimum of 2 seconds. This splash-screen 
is displayed on the standard Ogre configuration dialog anyway, so if you use that 
you don't need to do anything extra. The logo is included in the download archive 
as Examples\Resources\ogrelogo.png.</p><p>Some textures distrubuted with Ogre
