Lwo2Mesh v0.87 by Dennis Verbeek (dennis.verbeek@chello.nl)

Lwo2Mesh is a commandline tool to convert lightwave objects into ogre-meshes. Use -? to get help. Use *.lwo to convert multiple objects in one run.

The lightwave-object loading code is based on Lightwave SDK code by Ernie Wright.

The executable was compiled against Ogre v0.11. So you need that version to use it without re-compiling anything.

As of 2003.07.20 I will stop actively developing this tool. The complete source is now included. The source is freeware and as always:

Have fun with it but please give credit where credit's due.
