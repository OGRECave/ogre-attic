  <title>Using the 3DS Max exporter</title>

<body>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How to use
the 3DS exporter</span><br>
<br>
Please read '<a href="install.txt">install.txt</a>' for information on
how to install the exporter.<br>
<br>
Features of the exporter:<br>
<ul>
  <li>exports meshes</li>
  <li>exports bones, vertex assignements and bones animation, using the
skin modifier</li>
  <li>optionally exports embedded material definitions, however you are
better to simply assign named materials and use an OGRE .material
script to define them, since you can then use the full OGRE material
properties.</li>
  <li>exports everything to XML, which allows you to review or alter
the exported details if you wish. The CML must be converted to OGRE
binary format using XMLConverter before runtime use.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How to use
it</span><br>
<ol>
  <li>In the 'Ogre Tools' toolbar, click the 'Export to OGRE' button</li>
  <li>Click the 'Select A Mesh' button and pick the mesh you wish to
export</li>
  <li>Tick the'Export Mesh' checkbox if you want to export the geometry
of the object</li>
  <li>Tick the 'Export Skeleton' box if you want to export the skeleton
and animations. Specify the name you want to give the animation, the
range and duration.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Specify an output file name which will be used as a base for all
exported files</li>
  <li>Click 'Export'</li>
</ol>
This will create XML files called &lt;outputfile&gt;.mesh.xml and
&lt;outputfile&gt;.skeleton.xml. The former contains the geometry,
material links and bone assignments, the latter contains the definition
of the skeleton and the animation which was exported. Note that it is
possible to have more than one animation for the skeleton in the same
skeleton file, all you have to do is export the animations to separate
files, and combine the extra animations in one XML file by adding the
&lt;animation&gt; node&nbsp; and all it's children to the one
&lt;animations&gt; node on the combined file, with a text editor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Converting
XML to binary files</span><br>
Once you're happy with the files, you need to convert them to OGRE's
binary formats to use them at runtime (XML is too inefficient to use
for large data structures like meshes at runtime).<br>
<br>
To do this, you need to use the XMLConverter tool, provided in the Ogre
source tree under ogrenew/Tools/XMLConverter, or available as a
precompiled binary if required. Simply run:<br>
<pre>XMLConverter &lt;xml filename&gt;</pre>
.. on both the .mesh.xml and .skeleton.xml files, and XMLConverter will
produce .mesh and .skeleton binary files out of the XML. These can then
be placed into your OGRE resource locations for runtime use.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Issues<br>
</span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING </span>: Always create
new bones as children of another AND don't unlink and re-link a bone.
For example, if you have created a leg, copy all the bones and then use
position controller in a track view to move it and so get the other leg. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING</span> : Don't use mirror
when you create your bones because results are strange.</li>
  <li>Sometimes XMLConverter reports a message about not being able to
find the .skeleton file when converting a .mesh.xml. Do not worry about
this, this is because the converter uses the runtime objects from OGRE
itself and has not established any resource locations; <br>
this message will not affect the validity of the .mesh produced.</li>
  <li>At every keyframe, you have to had a key for position x,y,z and
rotation x,y,z, otherwise you will have an error message: "a key
missing for a track" or something like that. To get around this, use
the&nbsp; 'Add missing keys for selected object' button at the bottom
of the export dialog.</li>
  <li>Frame 0 must be a keyframe and at this keyframe, bones mustn't be
rotated, they must be in their rest position. If you want to begin your
animation with a different position, start animating at a higher frame
number and tell the exporter to start from there.</li>
  <li>There is sometimes a problem with mapping. Try to add a UVW map
modifier.</li>
  <li>Only skeletal animation is supported, so a 'skin' modifier is
required.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>A new material is
available in the material editor: OGRE Material. Only this kind of
material can be embedded in the .mesh; however, in any case it is
better to simply name your materials and use a .material script to
define the material, that way you can use all the OGRE material
properties.</li>
</ul>
The OGRE team would like to thank John Martin and EarthquakeProof for
developing this exporter.<br>
