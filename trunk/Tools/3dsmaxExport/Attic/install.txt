To install the 3ds exporter, do the following:

1. Copy the folders images, plugins, scripts, and ui to your 3dsMax root folder (e.g. c:\3dsMax)
2. Start 3D Studio
3. Open the 'Customize' menu and select 'Load Custom UI Scheme'
4. In the dialog, change 'Files of Type' to 'UI File(*.cui)'
5. Navigate to your 3dsMax\ui folder and double-click 'ogreTools.cui'

That's it, you should now have an 'Ogre Tools' toolbar with 2 buttons on it.


The OGRE Team would like to thank John Martin and earthquakeProof for developing this exporter.
