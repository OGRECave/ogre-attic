<H2 ALIGN=CENTER >3dsmax skeleton and mesh export </H2>

Here are 3dsmax4/5 scripts which export meshes and skeletons.<BR><BR>

<H3>Tutorials</H3>
<UL>
<LI> <B>you can find a mesh tutorial <a href="tutorials/skateboard/index.html">here</A>.</B></LI>
<LI> <B>you can find a skeleton tutorial <a href="tutorials/skeleton/index.html">here</A>.</B></LI>
</UL>


<H3>XMLConverter (OgreXMLConverter)</H3>

3ds scripts write .xml files. So, in order to have .mesh and .skeleton files, XMLConverter.exe should be used.
It's in Tools/XMLConverter/bin/debug directory.

<H4>Issues</H4>
XMLConverter doesn't find the skeleton file when you try to convert your mesh file even if it has been created. So there is
an eror message, but don't care: it works well when an OGRE application uses it.

<H3>Scripts Features</H3>

<UL>
  <LI> exports meshes.</LI>
  <LI> exports bones, vertex assignements and bones animation, using the skin modifier.</LI>
  <LI> exports multi-sub object materials.</LI>

<H3>How to use the script</H3>

<UL>
  <LI> <U>Exporting Meshes:</U>
    <UL>
      <LI> You can choose to export colour information and/or texture information. <BR>
           <B>CAUTION: </B>Colour information is not complete. This information is not used during rendering and values exported
             are just RGBA (25500255 = 255 0 0 255)</LI>
      <LI> You are able to export meshes which are made up of several submeshes. Behaviour is unknown if different submeshes
           are linked to a skeleton (it has not been tested but should works). </LI>
      <LI> <B> About material names: </B> because there could be several submeshes and one Multi/Sub-Object assigned, 
           each submeshes will be assigned the materialName_Subi material, where i is the submesh number.</LI>
    </UL>

  <LI> <U>Exporting skeletons:</U>
    <UL>
      <LI> There is sometimes a problem with mapping. Try to had a UVW map modifier.<BR></LI>
      <LI> <B>CAUTION:</B> Always create new bones as children of another AND don't unlink and re-link a bone. For example, if you have 
           created a leg, copy all the bones and then use position controller in a track view to move it and so get the other leg.
      <LI> <B>AND</B> : Don't use mirror when you create your bones because results are strange. </LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI> <U>Exporting materials:</U>
    <UL>
      <LI> Only Multi-Sub Object materials can be exported.
      <LI> Press the pick button, choose your material (for example from mtlEditor section), and choose "Instance" in order to avoid
           garabages.
    </UL>
  </LI>
