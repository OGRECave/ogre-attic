export-to-ogrexml.py:

An exporter for static meshes.
This exporter requires that you have Python 2.2 and the libxml2 Python module.
This is pretty easy to obtain on Linux, but on Windows you can get it from
http://users.skynet.be/sbi/libxml-python/.


ogreexport.py:

Export script for blender 2.28 or newer, which can export meshes and
skeletons with animation.
Material definitions and sticky uv textures are exported, too.
