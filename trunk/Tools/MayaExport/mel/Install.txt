1. Copy the maya2ogre_*.mel files to your Maya scripts directory.
   Typically "My Documents/maya/scripts" or "My Documents/maya/[ver]/scripts" in Windows.

2. Update userSetup.mel:
   a. If userSetup.mel does not exist in your scripts directory, copy it there
   b. If userSetup.mel exists in your script directory, append the new userSetup.mel to the end

3. Launch Maya

4. Use the Export option on the new Ogre menu (next to Help)


Note: The export script requires that Maya2Ogre.exe and OgreXMLConverter.exe are both on your path.
