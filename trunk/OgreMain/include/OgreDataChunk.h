    /** Wraps a chunk of memory, storing both size and a pointer to the data.
	    @remarks
		    This class simply wraps a chunk of memory. It provides extra info
		    about the size of the data contained within it, simple allocation
		    and free methods, and simple stream-like 'read' methods for
		    parsing through the memory chunk rather like a file.
	    @note
		    <br>By default the DataChunk object will <b>NOT</b> free any
		    memory it has allocated <b>EVEN WHEN DESTROYED</b>.
	    @par
		    This is for efficiency since you may just want to reuse the
		    memory as-is rather than copying it elsewhere, and it also allows
		    the DataChunk to be copied safely, i.e. when returned from
		    methods. At some point you should call DataChunk::free to release
		    the memory if you wish.
	    @par
		    If you need a DataChunk that frees the allocated memory on
		    destruction, use SDDataChunk instead.
	    @see
		    SDDataChunk
