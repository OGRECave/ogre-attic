            This class deals with the runtime management of
            skeleton data; like other resource managers it handles
            the creation of resources (in this case skeleton data),
            working within a fixed memory budget.

        @remarks
        Why do we do this? Well, it's because the Singleton
        implementation is in a .h file, which means it gets compiled
        into anybody who includes it. This is needed for the
        Singleton template to work, but we actually only want it
        compiled into the implementation of the class based on the
        Singleton, not all of them. If we don't change this, we get
        link errors when trying to use the Singleton-based class from
        an outside dll.
        @par
        This method just delegates to the template version anyway,
        but the implementation stays in this single compilation unit,
        preventing link errors.
