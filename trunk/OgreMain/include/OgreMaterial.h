    /** Class encapsulates rendering properties of an object.
    @remarks
    Ogre's material class encapsulates ALL aspects of the visual appearance,
    of an object. It also includes other flags which 
    might not be traditionally thought of as material properties such as 
    culling modes and depth buffer settings, but these affect the 
    appearance of the rendered object and are convenient to attach to the 
    material since it keeps all the settings in one place. This is 
    different to Direct3D which treats a material as just the colour 
    components (diffuse, specular) and not texture maps etc. An Ogre 
    Material can be thought of as equivalent to a 'Shader'.
    @par
    A Material can be rendered in multiple different ways depending on the
    hardware available. You may configure a Material to use high-complexity
    fragment shaders, but these won't work on every card; therefore a Technique
    is an approach to creating the visual effect you are looking for. You are advised
    to create fallback techniques with lower hardware requirements if you decide to
    use advanced features. In addition, you also might want lower-detail techniques
    for distant geometry.
    @par
    Each technique can be made up of multiple passes. A fixed-function pass
    may combine multiple texture layers using multitexrtuing, but Ogre can 
    break that into multiple passes automatically if the active card cannot
    handle that many simultaneous textures. Programmable passes, however, cannot
    be split down automatically, so if the active graphics card cannot handle the
    technique which contains these passes, OGRE will try to find another technique
    which the card can do. If, at the end of the day, the card cannot handle any of the
    techniques which are listed for the material, the engine will render the 
    geometry plain white, which should alert you to the problem.
    @par
    Ogre comes configured with a number of default settings for a newly 
    created material. These can be changed if you wish by retrieving the 
    default material settings through 
    SceneManager::getDefaultMaterialSettings. Any changes you make to the 
    Material returned from this method will apply to any materials created 
    from this point onward.

            A Technique is a single way of rendering geometry in order to achieve the effect
            you are intending in a material. There are many reason why you would want more than
            one - the main one being to handle variable graphics card abilities; you might have
            one technique which is impressive but only runs on 4th-generation graphics cards, 
            for example. In this case you will want to create at least one fallback Technique.
            OGRE will work out which Techniques a card can support and pick the best one.
        @par
            If multiple Techniques are available, the order in which they are created is 
            important - the engine will consider lower-indexed Techniques to be preferable
            to higher-indexed Techniques, ie when asked for the 'best' technique it will
