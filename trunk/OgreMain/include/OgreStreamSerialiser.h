	/** Utility class providing helper methods for reading / writing 
		structured data held in a DataStream.
	@remarks
		The structure of a file read / written by this class is a series of 
		'chunks'. A chunk-based format has the advantage of being extensible later, 
		and it's robust, in that a reader can skip chunks that they are not 
		able (or willing) to process.
	@par
		Chunks are contained serially in the file, but they can also be 
		nested in order both to provide context, and to group chunks together for 
		potential skipping. 
	@par
		The data format of a chunk is as follows:
		-# Chunk ID (32-bit uint). This can be any number unique in a context, except the numbers 0x0000, 0x0001 and 0x1000, which are reserved for Ogre's use
		-# Chunk version (16-bit uint). Chunks can change over time so this version number reflects that
		-# Length (32-bit uint). The length of the chunk data section, including nested chunks. Note that
			this length excludes this header, but includes the header of any nested chunks. 
		-# Checksum (32-bit uint). Checksum value generated from the above - basically lets us check this is a valid chunk.
		-# Chunk data
		The 'Chunk data' section will contain chunk-specific data, which may include
		other nested chunks.
