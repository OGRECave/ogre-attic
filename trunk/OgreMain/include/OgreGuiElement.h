    /** Abstract definition of a 2D element to be displayed in an Overlay.
    @remarks
        This class abstracts all the details of a 2D element which will appear in
        an overlay. In fact, not all GuiElement instances can be directly added to an
        Overlay, only those which are GuiContainer instances (a subclass of this class).
        GuiContainer objects can contain any GuiElement however. This is just to 
        enforce some level of grouping on widgets.
    @par
        GuiElements should be managed using GuiManager. This class is responsible for
        instantiating / deleting elements, and also for accepting new types of element
        from plugins etc.
    @par
        Note that positions / dimensions of 2D screen elements are expressed as parametric
        values (0.0 - 1.0) because this makes them resolution-independent. However, most
        screen resolutions have an aspect ratio of 1.3333:1 (width : height) so note that
        in physical pixels 0.5 is wider than it is tall, so a 0.5x0.5 panel will not be
        square on the screen (but it will take up exactly half the screen in both dimensions).
    @par
        Because this class is designed to be extensible, it subclasses from StringInterface
        so its parameters can be set in a generic way.

            does is establish the origin. This is because this way you can align multiple things
