    /** Defines an instance of a discrete, movable object based on a Mesh.
        @remarks
            Ogre generally divides renderable objects into 2 groups, discrete
            (separate) and relatively small objects which move around the world,
            and large, sprawling geometry which makes up generally immovable
            scenery, aka 'level geometry'.
        @par
            The Mesh and SubMesh classes deal with the definition of the geometry
            used by discrete movable objects. Entities are actual instances of
            objects based on this geometry in the world. Therefore there is
            usually a single set Mesh for a car, but there may be multiple
            entities based on it in the world. Entities are able to override
            aspects of the Mesh it is defined by, such as changing material
            properties per instance (so you can have many cars using the same
            geometry but different textures for example). Because a Mesh is split
            into SubMeshes for this purpose, the Entity class is a grouping class
            (much like the Mesh class) and much of the detail regarding
            individual changes is kept in the SubEntity class. There is a 1:1
            relationship between SubEntity instances and the SubMesh instances
            associated with the Mesh the Entity is based on.
        @par
            Entity and SubEntity classes are never created directly. Use the
            createEntity method of the SceneManager (passing a model name) to
            create one.
        @par
            Entities are included in the scene by associating them with a
            SceneNode, using the attachEntity method. See the SceneNode class
            for full information.
        @note
            No functions were declared virtual to improve performance.
