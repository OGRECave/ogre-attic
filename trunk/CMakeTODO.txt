TODO
====

Essential before switch-on as primary system

* SDK testing
* Establish 3rd-party library build procedure
  * For projects using CMake: Need to enhance/finish the FindOGRE and OGREConfig scripts
  * For projects not using CMake: Probably little changes, but examples would still be good
* Test Code::Blocks / MinGW, Linux

Optional 

* GLES project
* Investigate OSX (may have to continue to use custom XCode project)
* Reference app? (or drop this)
* CPack
  * NSIS installer working, but doesn't set OGRE_HOME environment variable yet.
  * Investigate .deb, .rpm packages for Linux

OGRE CHANGES ONCE LIVE
======================

- Docs/src/html.cfg is no longer necessary as it is generated from CMakeTemplates/html.cfg.in
- Remove Dependencies/CMakeLists.txt from OGRE source tree. This file should be provided by
  the pre-built dependencies package.
- Restructure pre-built dependencies packages to place DLLs in Dependencies/bin instead of
  Samples/Common/bin, since the latter is no longer in use
