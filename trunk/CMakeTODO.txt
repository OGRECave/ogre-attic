TODO

Essential before switch-on as primary system

* Install samples sources
  * Should probably rearrange the samples directory
* SDK testing
* Establish 3rd-party library build procedure
* Test Code::Blocks / MinGW, Linux

Optional 

* GLES project
* Investigate OSX (may have to continue to use custom XCode project)
* Reference app? (or drop this)
* CPack
  * Started work on this

OGRE CHANGES ONCE LIVE
======================

- Remove OgreConfig.h from OgreMain/include => CMakeTemplates/OgreConfig.h.in
- Move Ogre version information from OgrePrerequisites.h => CMakeTemplates/OgreVersion.h.in
- NOTE: If a custom XCode project is kept, OgreConfig.h and OgreVersion.h must still be
  provided. CMake builds will use the generated versions instead.
- Docs/src/html.cfg is no longer necessary as it is generated from CMakeTemplates/html.cfg.in
