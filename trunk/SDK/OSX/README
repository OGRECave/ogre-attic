Prerequisites for Building SDK
------------------------------

1. Doxygen installed

As well as installing Doxygen from the .dmg as per usual, you also need to put the doxygen and dot executables on your path. This could be as simple as copying them from /Applications/Doxygen/Contents/Resources to /usr/local/bin for example.

2. XCode and PackageMaker installed

Installing the developer tools should sort this out.
