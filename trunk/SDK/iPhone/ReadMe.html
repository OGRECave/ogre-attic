README file</p>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">Getting Started</p>

<p>This distribution contains the precompiled SDK release of OGRE for iPhone SDK. Just drag the 'OgreSDK' folder to the location on your drive where you want to install the SDK. Please do drag the entire folder rather than opening it and copying any subfolders, since the internal folder structure is relevant when building the samples.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b>If you have used a previous version of OGRE, make sure you <i>remove</i> Ogre.framework, CEGUI.Framework, Cg.framework and OgreCEGUIRenderer.framework from your /Library/Frameworks folder or any other 'root' folder. From version 1.4.5, all frameworks are referenced and deployed locally which is much more flexible when dealing with multiple versions, and also reflects how you would want to deploy an end application (see below).</p>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">Building the Samples</p>

<p>After installing the SDK, you can build the samples simply by navigating to the OgreSDK/Samples folder and double-clicking on Samples.Xcodeproj. In Xcode you can then build all the samples. </p>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">Limitations of the SDK</p>

<ul><li><b>Only Release Configurations</b>: only the release mode build is included for size reasons. You can still build debug code of your own against the release mode SDK, but you can only build the release mode samples.</li>
<li><b>Single Architecture</b>: only a single architecture (i386) is included in the SDK, again for size reasons.</li>
</ul>

You can build multiple architectures and the debug version by obtaining the source release.

<p class="mainheader" align="left">Deploying your own applications</p>
<p>In order to conform with standard iPhone application behaviour, applications should contain all the dependencies they need inside the .app file in order to be installable via drag & drop. The Samples provided with this SDK cheat here to avoid copying dependencies verbatim into every single sample .app folder - instead we use a Run Script build phase to create a symbolic link in the Fo.app/Contents/Frameworks location which points to each framework in the Dependencies folder. You can do something similar for development but when you distribute a real application, obviously you will need to actually copy the dependencies properly into Foo.app so it can be deployed as a unit.</p>
