        To allow the GuiElement types available for inclusion on 
        overlays to be extended, OGRE allows external apps or plugins
        to register their ability to create custom GuiElements with
        the GuiManager, using the addGuiElementFactory method. Classes
        wanting to do this must implement this interface.
    @par
        Each GuiElementFactory creates a single type of GuiElement, 
        identified by a 'type name' which must be unique.
