            Shadow map matrices, being projective matrices, have 15 degrees of freedom.
			3 of these degrees of freedom are fixed by the light's position.  4 are used to
			affinely affect z values.  6 affinely affect u,v sampling.  2 are projective
			degrees of freedom.  This class is meant to allow custom methods for 
			handling optimization.

        @remarks
            Given a plane of interest, it is possible to set up the shadow camera
			matrix such that the mapping between screen and shadow map is the identity
			(when restricted to pixels that view the plane of interest).  Therefore,
			if the shadow map resolution matches the screen space resolution (of the 
			seen planar receiver), we can get pixel perfect shadowing on the plane. 
			Off the plane, the shadowing is not guaranteed to be perfect and will 
			likely exhibit the usual sampling artifacts associated with shadow mapping.
