        @remarks
            This method creates a new vertex buffer; this will act as a source of geometry
            data for rendering objects. Note that because the meaning of the contents of
            the vertex buffer depends on the usage, this method does not specify a
            vertex format; the user of this buffer can actually insert whatever data 
            they wish, in any format. However, in order to use this with a RenderOperation,
            the data in this vertex buffer will have to be associated with a semantic element
            of the rendering pipeline, e.g. a position, or texture coordinates. This is done 
            using the VertexDeclaration class, which itself contains VertexElement structures
            referring to the source data.
        @remarks Note that because vertex buffers can be shared, they are reference
            counted so you do not need to worry about destroying themm this will be done
            automatically.
        @param vertexSize The size in bytes of each vertex in this buffer; you must calculate
            this based on the kind of data you expect to populate this buffer with.
        @param numVerts The number of vertices in this buffer.
        @param usage One or more members of the HardwareBuffer::Usage enumeration; you are
            strongly advised to use HBU_STATIC_WRITE_ONLY wherever possible, if you need to 
            update regularly, consider HBU_DYNAMIC_WRITE_ONLY and useShadowBuffer=true.
		@param useShadowBuffer If set to true, this buffer will be 'shadowed' by one stored in 
            system memory rather than GPU or AGP memory. You should set this flag if you intend 
            to read data back from the vertex buffer, because reading data from a buffer
			in the GPU or AGP memory is very expensive, and is in fact impossible if you
            specify HBU_WRITE_ONLY for the main buffer. If you use this option, all 
            reads and writes will be done to the shadow buffer, and the shadow buffer will
            be synchronised with the real buffer at an appropriate time.

            @remarks
                Why do we do this? Well, it's because the Singleton
                implementation is in a .h file, which means it gets compiled
                into anybody who includes it. This is needed for the
                Singleton template to work, but we actually only want it
                compiled into the implementation of the class based on the
                Singleton, not all of them. If we don't change this, we get
                link errors when trying to use the Singleton-based class from
                an outside dll.
            @par
                This method just delegates to the template version anyway,
                but the implementation stays in this single compilation unit,
                preventing link errors.
