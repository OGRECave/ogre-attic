    /** Manages particle systems, particle system scripts (templates) and the available emitter & affector factories.
    @remarks
        This singleton class is responsible for creating and managing particle systems. All particle
        systems must be created and destroyed using this object. Remember that like all other MovableObject
        subclasses, ParticleSystems do not get rendered until they are attached to a SceneNode object.
    @par
        This class also manages factories for ParticleEmitter and ParticleAffector classes. To enable easy
        extensions to the types of emitters (particle sources) and affectors (particle modifiers), the
        ParticleSystemManager lets plugins or applications register factory classes which submit new
        subclasses to ParticleEmitter and ParticleAffector. Ogre comes with a number of them already provided,
        such as cone, sphere and box-shaped emitters, and simple affectors such as constant directional force
        and colour faders. However using this registration process, a plugin can create any behaviour
        required.
    @par
        This class also manages the loading and parsing of particle system scripts, which are text files
        describing named particle system templates. Instances of particle systems using these templates can
        then be created easily through the createParticleSystem method.

            This method allows plugins etc to add new particle emitter types to Ogre. Particle emitters
            are sources of particles, and generate new particles with their start positions, colours and
            momentums appropriately. Plugins would create new subclasses of ParticleEmitter which 
            emit particles a certain way, and register a subclass of ParticleEmitterFactory to create them (since multiple

            affectors modify the particles in a system a certain way such as affecting their direction
