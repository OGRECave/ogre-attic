            This class deals with the runtime management of
            mesh data; like other resource managers it handles
            the creation of resources (in this case mesh data),

                Ogre loads model files from it's own proprietary
                format called .mesh. This is because having a single file
                format is better for runtime performance, and we also have
                control over pre-processed data (such as
                collision boxes, LOD reductions etc).
